Dr.Nick.Sokolov CRD,PhD(Wavelets).MS.BE.(ME&EE) owner CRD P/L,"This is a collection Tip of the Day21st Century(ToD21stC111-120), As it was over the Christmas - New Year 2021-22 period, it contains some of my personal posts on electric bike usage and advantages. But in essence this collection is centred around a Hybrid Stepper motor technology that we use in producing helical gears for our unidirectional worsted comb including drives for the worsted comb ( technology worth billions to csiro and Australian economy#abares). This is long standing dispute with csiro about IP and technology release I developed partly while in their employment, before my ""redunducy"" and mostly as CRD P/L.  This includes documented patent and IP surrounding the Sokolov Cam system which was used to greatly increased the productivity of the worsted comb. Technology was claimed by my superior by the virtue of creating my position within csiro to look into a solution to improve a productivity of the worsted comb, a problem that perplexed csiro for more then 50 years resulting in their failure of management of science to hold on to the technology once my first patent was produced. I have now taken that technology forward by creating a working prototype of a uni-directional comb that runs in a single direction without apron reversal. The technology that csiro lost I covered in past publications, but it was a win for the NSC Schlumberger with no return to Australia or csiro. CSIRO attempted to take my technology forward but failed - I guess not all engineers or scientists are created equal. The NSC Schlumberger expressed no interest in moving the technology forward since it was not in their economic interest - being the only manufacturer of the combing tech other then my company based in Australia.#csiro#xcsiro. The NSC Schlumberger expressed interest in my self as technology innovator, and according to them; ""csiro was a known quantity"", that was nice compliment after my treatment by csiro management. Through my publications on LinkedIn serve neither interest of csiro or myself or Australia or NSC Schlumberger as I will eventually publish enough material to make it viable for manufacturing of the worsted comb in#chinaat very reduced cost. However the upside is that it will be beneficial to fibre produces around the world, however not to NSC Schlumberger, csiro or my company CRD P/L or#australianmanufacturing. Perhaps there are alternatives to this and it needs to be explored. The China will play part in all of this as they are manufacturing power house of the 21st century, to dislike of USA. 21st century is becoming harder to revers complex engineering technology without direct knowledge."
