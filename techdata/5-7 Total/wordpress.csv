Darshil Parmar,Kick start your Data Engineering career with me | YouTube @Darshil Parmar,"😵‍💫 Data Engineering is dying? 😵‍💫👨🏻‍💻 I have been reading a lot of blogs about new tools and technology👉🏻 The point people are making is, the majority of data engineering work can either be automated or using modern data products we can do things easily➡️ Don't write ETL just use SQL for all the transformation➡️ Don't even write code, just drag and drop functions and create flow🤓 So many new products and trying to make things easierSo the question - is data engineering dying?🥲 I don't think so🕵🏻‍♂️ I have seen this pattern for web development also💻 I started my Web Dev career with LAMP stack and with the rise of new tools WordPress, Wix, WebFlow, and many more🚴🏻‍♂️ People started thinking, that web development will be just drag and dropBut that's not the case👉🏻 It created a market for two types of people 👈🏻1. For those who need to code and build things2. For those who can just use the no-code tool and quickly get startedThe same thing might happen here1. Companies that have their entire infra on the existing system might not migrate it or may go hybrid?2. New startups can use tools to do things faster3. New jobs will be created for people who are experts with new tools?It is still early and we don't know what the future holdsBut asking questions can lead to a better understandingWhat do you think guys?Benjamin RogojanAndreas KretzZach WilsonSaikat DuttaRahul jain 🇮🇳#dataengineering#dataengineer#datawithdarshil#sql"

It makes little things grow and big mistakes fade away.➡️RISK है तो इश्क है:-We should like risk because it pays off over the time. The term calculated risk matters here.I have learned many things from this book, But couldn't share everything so I summarised it in a short and sweet manner. I am a WordPress developer so if you need any help let me know...I will be there.THANKS FOR READING THIS POST🙂#wordpress#work#money#investing#psychology#booksummary#books#entrepreneur#books"

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"8 classy WordPress Hacks that every developer needs to know🧵⬇1️⃣ Pick a theme carefully because switching later is a hassle👉 With WordPress, you have a wide range of choices when it comes to themes. WordPress themes such as Elementor and Divi are truly impressive. Most importantly, they feature an easy-to-use website editor.2️⃣ Make your website's typography stand out by adding custom fonts👉 Calibri and Arial can get a bit boring after a while. The first step to improving the typography of a website is for the developer to make it as eye-catching as possible.3️⃣ Limit down the plugins on your website so they don't slow it down👉 It's not just about loading speed, but plugins continue to consume server resources in the background. A number of them increase database queries that sucks bandwidth.4️⃣ Save your and client's time too by choosing right page builders👉 Because of their many features, drag-and-drop interfaces, and flexible layouts, some, but not all, page builder plugins are inefficiently coded. There's a real danger of performance issues and a slow website is bad news for SEO.So figure out the best page builders for your website, Elementor and DIVI are performing good in this.5️⃣ Optimize your page loading time by compressing images👉 The size of images is one of the most important factors affecting page load speeds. Using WordPress for e-commerce poses a big problem because these sites rely heavily on images. Thats the reason compressing the image is a good habit for a WordPress developer.6️⃣ Protect the frontend to prevent hacks👉 Choose a top-of-the-line security plugin, such as Sucuri or Jetpack. Although hosting companies claim their security systems are invincible, it doesn't hurt to be cautious.Replacehttps://lnkd.in/dUt8ffdcfrommysite.com/wp-login.phpor /wp-admin/7️⃣ Use permalinks that support SEO👉 There is an URL for every page of the site, such ashttps://lnkd.in/d2W8PFMg. Your browser uses this to find the page. As a default, WordPress uses a query string such asmywebsite.com/?p=898️⃣ To reduce scroll lengths, use comment pagination settings👉 Go to Settings > Discussion and scroll to Other Comment Settings. Now tick Break Comments Into Pages.🤞 Final thoughts!There are so many customization options with WordPress that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, we choose hacks that are easy to use and widely applicable.Cheers!#wordpress#seo#developer#frontend#typography#commerce#elementor#divibuilder#wordpresswebsite"

Preeti Gupta,SEO is what drives me everyday.,"What is AMP?Known as Accelerated Mobile Pages, it shows the stripped-down version of a page in the SERPs.When it was launched in 2016, everyone thought this was ""the next big thing"" because of how much it helps, but slowly the trend was out and nobody was talking about the same.❓ So how does AMP help websites?Mainly it had to do with speed. AMP cuts all the ""unnecessary"" elements from the page like ads, javascript, images, and more and only shows the main content. Because Google and users love the speed and fast loading of pages, marketers used them,❓ What are the disadvantages of using AMP pages?It can become difficult to implement if you don't use WordPress. You may need to get help from a developer.As the ads don't show up on the AMP pages, the revenue drops and you make less money.The content goes to the google cache server and the URL will redirect to the AMP version as well as you lose all the creative controls for the page.Many marketers say that they can't capture leads as all the downloadable assets and javascript elements get deleted.There are more cons than pros and that's why it's not the best strategy to implement.❓ Who should use AMP pages?You struggle with speed and after doing many things, you cant get your pages to speed up.If the majority of your traffic comes from mobile searches.If you want to capture leads, get revenue from Google ads, or have already a fast website then you may not need the AMP.This was a long one.Did you like it? then don't forget to like and comment.#amp#seo"

Suvam Sahoo,Your Go to WordPress Guy | Founder and CEO of Secure My WP,"If you’re building a site, if you’re a developer, or even if you’re a writer who writes articles about WordPress, you may find that you need to get a fresh install of WordPress every now and then to test different things from scratch.This can be time-consuming, especially if you need to do multiple fresh installs regularly.But you don't have to perform a full install every time you need a fresh install of WordPress!There’s a plugin called WP Reset that will let you reset WordPress as if it’s a fresh installation.To use this plugin, install it, then, go to Tools > WP Reset.Once you’re on the page, go to the Reset tab and scroll down to the very bottom. You will see a box where you need to type the word “reset” to use the Reset Site button to reset your site.This will now reset your installation as if it’s a brand new installation of WP.This is different from WordPress’s built-in reinstall function, which reinstalls WordPress but keeps your site’s data intact.On the contrary, WP Reset resets your WordPress installation as if it’s a truly fresh install. Your username and password remain the same, but everything else is removed.Keep in mind that your wp-uploads folder retains the files in it (but they won’t show up in your site’s media library anymore). To fix that, use WP Reset’s Clean uploads Folder tool in the Tools tab.If you found this post helpful, please comment ""WP reset"".#wordpress"

Chandan Kala,Assisting Medical Practitioners in increasing their online presence,"By now you guys might have understood how important it is to have a good online presence so I won't discuss that. Today I am going to discuss whether to have your own team or to outsource it to a company.I agree that having your own team (employees) to manage your digital presence sounds more promising compared to outsoursing it to a company.Just like every decision has its own pros and cons, you should weigh the benefits and challenges before taking a decision.The benefit of having your own marketing team is that you will have people who will work only for you and be available every day to get things done for you. They will have better domain expertise because they will be constantly working with you. The cost will be less when you get the same amount of work done by a third party.Now let's discuss the challenges of having your own team. Having your own marketing team is a very costly, time and energy consuming affair. For eg, for your digital marketing team you will need a medical content writer, general content writer, designer, video editor, developer (someone expert in html/css/js or wordpress), someone to do on page seo, off page seo, local seo, paid marketing expert (google ads or facebook ads), manager to manage all of them, etc. and these all fields are interlinked, even if one of the person is on leave other work might get hamper so you need to have a back up as well. Now think the amount of salary, time and energy that will go in keeping that team. And let me tell you good employees don't come cheap.Now you might say we can have an all-rounder, who knows everything. First of all, it's very difficult to find that person. Suppose you find one, what will you do if he/she switches the job or is not able to continue because of some medical reason. Nowadays, every company is facing the challenge of employee retention, be it fortune 500 or a local vendor so think of that point as well.So now the choice is up to you. Think before you act.#digitalmarketing#healthcaremarketing#marketing"

Prathamesh Sakhadeo,WordPress Expert,"WordPress is not secure, and I don't want to build my website using WordPress.How many times you've heard this from a client?It's true that WordPress is a very popular technology to build websites, and is prone to attack from hackers.But, many times it's the developer's mistake that the website is vulnerable.It's a known fact that the username of WordPress should not be admin.But we are too lazy to give a different username.Let's not even talk about the password. They are so easy to guess that the hacker must be feeling unchallenged.Another point is using nulled plugins and themes. Your website is face of your business and it needs investment.That means sometimes you need to purchase premium themes and plugins.But to save the cost, many people opt for illegally obtained nulled plugins and themes.Many times these are infested with malware and malicious scripts.Another reason for poor security is outdated themes and plugins. WordPress like any other software needs maintenance and that means you need to update themes and plugins regularly.Installing plugins like WordFence and changing the login URL of WordPress also helps a lot.So, yes, WordPress is prone to attacks but you can make it secure.#wordpress#wordpresssecurity"

Farhatabassum Khan,Founder | I help businesses to build remarkable branding & websites.,"Debunking Common WordPress Website Myths🔮 Myth #5: Every small external task needs a plugin💯 Facts: WordPress is an open-source platform, you can learn it, use the code, improve the code, and can customize it according to your needs.💡 If you know how to use and customize WordPress code, there are endless possibilities to customize and add any functionality to your website.💡 Developers have developed a plugin for everything and contributed to making a big easy to use platform.💡 If you don't want to use a plugin then you don't have to. Plugins are great for someone who doesn't know how to code.Takeaway:If you don't want to use N number of plugins to develop a great website for your business, then hire freelancers or an agency just likeAxial Design Studio. We will help you to develop a great customized website for your special brand.##wordpress#wordpresswebsitedesign#wordpressmyths#wordpresswebsite#business"

Nikhil Bhansali,"Youtuber, Video Marketer, Content Creator :)","No BS SEO guideSEO is trying to get yourself discovered by your customers searching about their problems and solutions. It can be on Google, Amazon, YouTube - whichever the search engine the basics are the same.2 words to summarise everything you need to know about SEO - Content and Distribution.Let's start with#distributionYou need a FAST website, so fast that You don't notice the time between clicking on link and opening the page. Choose a blogging platform which works well, after lot of testing I can suggest#superblog. If you're planning to use wordpress, make sure you have a developer resource full time to optimise your site constantly.Next you need to figure out what your clients are searching for. In the language they're searching for (crucial point many businesses ignore). You must have heard this a 100 times but priorities topic which is the intersection of- Good volume (100k+ searches for B2C, 1000+ searches for B2B monthly)- Low competition- Common senseThe difference between a good SEO expert and a great one is Common Sense first 2 bits are easy, third one is hard.After you complete the above research for distribution (which for a startup shouldn't take more than 8 hours) it's time to shift our focus to#contentI cannot emphasize this enough, do any black hat techniques, do whatever back linking, do any amount of SEO hacks none of it matters if your content is not excellent.Most companies spend 80-90% of their SEO#timeon things other than content. While it should be the other way around.There is no cure for bad content. You'll be surprised how many things you can get away with if you stop EVERYTHING ELSE and focus on just good content. Write compelling, thoughtful, well researched content and reap the benefits for YEARS. Your content should be so well written that you have to NEVER request for backlinks - they should come on their own.Do these 2 basics consistently and Keep Calm. Traffic will come.Don't splurge on expensive tools, consultants (when you're starting) and other guides. just follow the above steps.Any doubts let me know but this has worked for me time and again."

Amol Firke,"We Build Beautiful Websites That Convert & Acquire Leads | Website Design, UI UX Design, Brand Design, Content Marketing, Email Marketing | Co-Founder of Think Big Digital","Before you update your WordPress plugins, you need to make a full site backup.I suggest using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus to handle this. It’s a pretty painless process.The primary reason developers update WordPress plugins might be for security issues.Making sure that your site is safe and secure should be your top priority. One of the biggest weaknesses in a WordPress site is its plugins.As amazing as they are, plugins can conflict with each other and your themes and developers often work tirelessly to patch vulnerabilities and update the plugins so that your site isn’t open to attack.Outdated plugins can have openings that can be compromised, so keeping them up to date is one of the top ways to keep your site online and running like it should.Do you take a backup before updating the plugins?---------------------------------------P.S.

Most of our applications are database centric, where the database is SQL Server. And, now we want to develop our own apps too.WE SEEK...We seek developers who understand that the value of a good algorithm is much more than the language or platform you are developing on.We seek developers who want to demonstrate their ability to handle mutiple platforms and code and develop excellent software.We seek developers who can switch from developing software onASP.netplatform to .PhP to Classic ASP to cloud native platforms.Yes, they will require a couple of days to read about the new encironments/languages, but they will be open to developing software on whichever platform we throw at them.KEY REQUIREMENTSWe need TWO such developers.We don't need any specific degree OR marks OR training certificates.Experience in CLASSIC ASP orASP.NETor .NET Core or WORDPRESS programming will be a bonus.Experience in jQuery, SQL Server will be a Super Bonus.You should be able to demonstrate your experience through contribution to an Open Source project, or a project developed for a client.We need YOU to have answered our basic Online Interview.We need YOU to be comfortable with a WORK FROM HOME arrangement OR be able to work out of our HQ (Okhla Phase 1 New Delhi).We will be singning a bond for 1 year.
