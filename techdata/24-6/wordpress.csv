Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"🚫 Don't Make These Mistakes If You Are a WordPress Developer 🚫📌 Failing to optimize media✔ Large, high-resolution images can be printed or cropped to be viewed at full scale without losing image quality. However, if uploaded directly to your WordPress media library, they will usually be stored as large and unoptimized images.📌 Ignoring the XML sitemap✔ Sitemaps are essential on larger websites because they enable search engines to crawl all of your pages. Unfortunately, this crucial feature is not yet native to WordPress, so you must use a plugin.📌 Missing Updates✔ In addition to patching performance, design, and usability issues, these updates also patch vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to access your website.📌 Installing poorly coded themes✔ The reason is that invalid HTML can cause rendering issues, which affect both users and search engines. In addition, many themes load a ridiculous amount of scripts, images, fonts, and other types of files, making it difficult for your pages to load quickly.📌 Excessive plugin installation✔ Adding functionality to WordPress is as simple as installing one or more plugins. But, such plugins often load a lot of scripts, CSS files, images, and fonts, further degrading speed and creating a poor user experience.📌 Neglecting security✔ Despite all your efforts, your website can never be completely secure. Hardening your security, on the other hand, will deter the vast majority of hackers, except those explicitly targeting you.📌 Failing to perform backups regularly.✔ You need to perform backups regularly. It is essential to have a website running smoothly. In addition to enabling you to roll back changes, it may also help you to quickly recover from a hack by restoring an older version of your site.📌 Eliminating the schema element.✔ Search engines use schema to determine what your content is about, and how the entities within the content relate to each other. Schema may not directly affect ranking, but additional visual cues can lead to an increased clickthrough rate.💡 Conclusion 💡It's hard to stop WordPress Development mistakes. Still, with a bit of forethought and hopefully a few of the following tips, you should be able to avoid costly blunders. Pay attention to the details, and you'll be fine!#wordpress#developer#design#html#css#wordpressdesign#wordpresstips#quality"

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"8 classy WordPress Hacks that every developer needs to know🧵⬇1️⃣ Pick a theme carefully because switching later is a hassle👉 With WordPress, you have a wide range of choices when it comes to themes. WordPress themes such as Elementor and Divi are truly impressive. Most importantly, they feature an easy-to-use website editor.2️⃣ Make your website's typography stand out by adding custom fonts👉 Calibri and Arial can get a bit boring after a while. The first step to improving the typography of a website is for the developer to make it as eye-catching as possible.3️⃣ Limit down the plugins on your website so they don't slow it down👉 It's not just about loading speed, but plugins continue to consume server resources in the background. A number of them increase database queries that sucks bandwidth.4️⃣ Save your and client's time too by choosing right page builders👉 Because of their many features, drag-and-drop interfaces, and flexible layouts, some, but not all, page builder plugins are inefficiently coded. There's a real danger of performance issues and a slow website is bad news for SEO.So figure out the best page builders for your website, Elementor and DIVI are performing good in this.5️⃣ Optimize your page loading time by compressing images👉 The size of images is one of the most important factors affecting page load speeds. Using WordPress for e-commerce poses a big problem because these sites rely heavily on images. Thats the reason compressing the image is a good habit for a WordPress developer.6️⃣ Protect the frontend to prevent hacks👉 Choose a top-of-the-line security plugin, such as Sucuri or Jetpack. Although hosting companies claim their security systems are invincible, it doesn't hurt to be cautious.Replacehttps://lnkd.in/dUt8ffdcfrommysite.com/wp-login.phpor /wp-admin/7️⃣ Use permalinks that support SEO👉 There is an URL for every page of the site, such ashttps://lnkd.in/d2W8PFMg. Your browser uses this to find the page. As a default, WordPress uses a query string such asmywebsite.com/?p=898️⃣ To reduce scroll lengths, use comment pagination settings👉 Go to Settings > Discussion and scroll to Other Comment Settings. Now tick Break Comments Into Pages.🤞 Final thoughts!There are so many customization options with WordPress that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, we choose hacks that are easy to use and widely applicable.Cheers!#wordpress#seo#developer#frontend#typography#commerce#elementor#divibuilder#wordpresswebsite"

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Programming habits that every developer should steal 👇🎯 Clean Up Your Code✔ Never forget that you are not only writing code for machines but yourself as well. Writing readable code is crucial because a good program is like writing a good poem.🎯 Planning Before Coding✔ Initially, it might seem exciting to jump into a coding project. In the process, though, you might lose sight of the bigger picture and become confused that's why you should plan and organize your code before you begin.🎯 Implement functions and classes✔ The best programming habit is creating functions or classes for code that will be reused occasionally. However, there is no point in rewriting code that's being reused repeatedly, as it adds to code bloat, resulting in an unnecessarily large and complex program.🎯 Find A Stronger Editor✔ Working with the right editors allows you to expand your knowledge and complete your projects more quickly. Therefore, I highly recommend using editors with code completion, such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Aptana Studio 3.🎯 Documentation✔ I recommend starting with areadme.mdfile that explains what the application is supposed to do, and how you can get it up and running. What's great about documentation is that you can write it when you code. Ensure that your variable names are descriptive - this will pay off in the long run.🎯 Do Version Control✔ Programming relies heavily on version control. When you build a simple piece of software, you might not think about version control immediately. However, over time, you will want to improve your code, regardless of its type.💥 Wrapping It UpYou can develop several habits to make yourself stand out as a programmer. We looked at seven of these habits that most developers lack.Build these habits one at a time for yourself. Remember to build these habits; you need time and consistency, which won't happen overnight.#developer#programming#wordpress#woocommerce#developers#shopify"

Here is the detail about it.1) Easier Editing with the Block Editor – This phase was just the first part of a four-phase plan to modernize WordPress. This Phase was the new block editor, which was released in WordPress version 5.0 and available for posts and pages.2) Full Site Editing Customization Options - This Phase is even easier for WordPress users to customize their websites without coding and also available as a plugin for earlier version of WordPress.3) Multi-Author Collaboration - This phase of the Gutenberg project is scheduled to start in 2022. After this phase, Gutenberg will allow multiple people to edit WordPress website content simultaneously, much like in Google Docs.4) Multilingual Website Support - Core implementation for Multi-lingual sites. The final phase of WordPress’s Gutenberg project will make multilingual support a core component of WordPress. After this release, developers will no need to use translation plugins like WPML. This phase will take us well beyond 2022.#wordpress,#wordpressplugin,#wordpresswebsite,#wordpressblog,#wordpressdevelopment,#wordpressblogger"

Suvam Sahoo,Your Go to WordPress Guy | Founder and CEO of Secure My WP,"If you’re building a site, if you’re a developer, or even if you’re a writer who writes articles about WordPress, you may find that you need to get a fresh install of WordPress every now and then to test different things from scratch.This can be time-consuming, especially if you need to do multiple fresh installs regularly.But you don't have to perform a full install every time you need a fresh install of WordPress!There’s a plugin called WP Reset that will let you reset WordPress as if it’s a fresh installation.To use this plugin, install it, then, go to Tools > WP Reset.Once you’re on the page, go to the Reset tab and scroll down to the very bottom. You will see a box where you need to type the word “reset” to use the Reset Site button to reset your site.This will now reset your installation as if it’s a brand new installation of WP.This is different from WordPress’s built-in reinstall function, which reinstalls WordPress but keeps your site’s data intact.On the contrary, WP Reset resets your WordPress installation as if it’s a truly fresh install. Your username and password remain the same, but everything else is removed.Keep in mind that your wp-uploads folder retains the files in it (but they won’t show up in your site’s media library anymore). To fix that, use WP Reset’s Clean uploads Folder tool in the Tools tab.If you found this post helpful, please comment ""WP reset"".#wordpress"

Sarang Pokhare (IIM Calcutta Alumni),"Senior Digital Marketing Manager @ Diamante Blockchain | IIM Calcutta | Inbound, PPC & Email Marketing | ICO & Crowdfunding Marketing","7 Simple Ways to Improve your Website Securityhttps://ift.tt/3MHi5emYour website’s security is one of the most important aspects of online business. After all, if you are trying to run a business, you do not want your site to go down or to have your customers’ data stolen. This would not only rob you of potential profits but also do devastating damage to your reputation. To avoid that, here are 7 simple ways to improve your website security.Find a good security pluginThe first step to improving your website security is always incorporating a strong security plugin into your site. Most sites nowadays seem to run using WordPress, which is very convenient considering the platform’s many plugins. Including amazing free plugins such as All In One WP Security & Firewall. This is especially ideal if you are just starting out and can’t really afford the paid versions yet.Most of those cost around sixty dollars a month for their ‘professional’ versions, which is actually not that bad at all. Some of the cheaper ones only cost around one hundred dollars for a whole year of professional support and security services. What recommends them, even more is that they tend to have all sorts of other useful features too. For example, most offer malware scanning and site backup services at no additional charge.Be careful with what you allow onto your websiteNaturally, one of the most important things to keep in mind is that you shouldn’t lightly select anything that affects the way your website runs. You may be spoilt for choice when it comes to WordPress plugins. But, if you are careless and go for some new, free, or especially cheap ones, you may end up in more trouble than they’re worth. They can pose security risks of all kinds.And some are even made by malicious parties who build backdoors into their code that would allow them to access your site’s data if you use their plugin. Another thing you need to learn about running a website is that website themes can be fraught with similar risks. In other words, anything you incorporate into your site has a chance of backfiring on you.Make sure your passwords are safeHaving a strong password is the most basic of basics when it comes to efforts to improve your website security. However, the experts from Movers Development warn that ignoring such ‘basics’ is a very risky thing to do. You do not want to use a weak password only to have someone actually guess it. That is one embarrassing way to lose a ton of data and your site.At the same time, keeping your password ‘safe’ is just as important. Do not just give out your access details to every employee. And even if the employee is trustworthy, make sure to instill the importance of not just letting the password lie around on sticky notes on them. Access details should also never be shared over social media or sketchy chatting apps. In fact, it is best not to share them online at all.Add two-factor authenticationTwo-factor authentication ..."

Prathamesh Sakhadeo,WordPress Expert,"WordPress is not secure, and I don't want to build my website using WordPress.How many times you've heard this from a client?It's true that WordPress is a very popular technology to build websites, and is prone to attack from hackers.But, many times it's the developer's mistake that the website is vulnerable.It's a known fact that the username of WordPress should not be admin.But we are too lazy to give a different username.Let's not even talk about the password. They are so easy to guess that the hacker must be feeling unchallenged.Another point is using nulled plugins and themes. Your website is face of your business and it needs investment.That means sometimes you need to purchase premium themes and plugins.But to save the cost, many people opt for illegally obtained nulled plugins and themes.Many times these are infested with malware and malicious scripts.Another reason for poor security is outdated themes and plugins. WordPress like any other software needs maintenance and that means you need to update themes and plugins regularly.Installing plugins like WordFence and changing the login URL of WordPress also helps a lot.So, yes, WordPress is prone to attacks but you can make it secure.#wordpress#wordpresssecurity"

Farhatabassum Khan,Founder | I help businesses to build remarkable branding & websites.,"Debunking Common WordPress Website Myths🔮 Myth #5: Every small external task needs a plugin💯 Facts: WordPress is an open-source platform, you can learn it, use the code, improve the code, and can customize it according to your needs.💡 If you know how to use and customize WordPress code, there are endless possibilities to customize and add any functionality to your website.💡 Developers have developed a plugin for everything and contributed to making a big easy to use platform.💡 If you don't want to use a plugin then you don't have to. Plugins are great for someone who doesn't know how to code.Takeaway:If you don't want to use N number of plugins to develop a great website for your business, then hire freelancers or an agency just likeAxial Design Studio.

Nikhil Bhansali,"Youtuber, Video Marketer, Content Creator :)","No BS SEO guideSEO is trying to get yourself discovered by your customers searching about their problems and solutions. It can be on Google, Amazon, YouTube - whichever the search engine the basics are the same.2 words to summarise everything you need to know about SEO - Content and Distribution.Let's start with#distributionYou need a FAST website, so fast that You don't notice the time between clicking on link and opening the page. Choose a blogging platform which works well, after lot of testing I can suggest#superblog. If you're planning to use wordpress, make sure you have a developer resource full time to optimise your site constantly.Next you need to figure out what your clients are searching for. In the language they're searching for (crucial point many businesses ignore). You must have heard this a 100 times but priorities topic which is the intersection of- Good volume (100k+ searches for B2C, 1000+ searches for B2B monthly)- Low competition- Common senseThe difference between a good SEO expert and a great one is Common Sense first 2 bits are easy, third one is hard.After you complete the above research for distribution (which for a startup shouldn't take more than 8 hours) it's time to shift our focus to#contentI cannot emphasize this enough, do any black hat techniques, do whatever back linking, do any amount of SEO hacks none of it matters if your content is not excellent.Most companies spend 80-90% of their SEO#timeon things other than content. While it should be the other way around.There is no cure for bad content. You'll be surprised how many things you can get away with if you stop EVERYTHING ELSE and focus on just good content. Write compelling, thoughtful, well researched content and reap the benefits for YEARS. Your content should be so well written that you have to NEVER request for backlinks - they should come on their own.Do these 2 basics consistently and Keep Calm. Traffic will come.Don't splurge on expensive tools, consultants (when you're starting) and other guides. just follow the above steps.Any doubts let me know but this has worked for me time and again."

Priyanka Guha,Digital Marketer & Content Writer at Appscrip,"Received the biggest compliment (so far) of my professional life yesterday. My teammates said, ""We don't need a writer and/or marketer, we need another Priyanka when you're gone. Make sure when the JD is put out, there is mention of not just what needs to be done for the company, but also, what we need in a team member, and a friend.""So I sat and drafted the job description (JD) of my replacement, for the marketing team.Professional requirements:1. Should be good in English. Mistakes are acceptable- but the lesser, the better.2. Should be equally good in copywriting and content writing. Or at least understand the difference. An added advantage if you know SEO writing.3. Should have an excellent eye for detail.4. Should be good in UI/UX writing, as the majority of the tasks would demand that.5. Should have a knack for website designs, as most of the time you would have to indulge in thorough research and later collaborate with designers and WordPress developers.6. Should know how to create weekly Newsletters for the products.7. Should have a knack for short videos (YT Shorts, Reels) to guide the video editors with content (both ideas and copy)8. Should be in sync with the latest trends to incorporate creativity in social media posts.9. Should know how to design/create infographics, handbooks, and (product) pitch decks.Personal requirements:10. Should be great in communication and comprehension.11. Should be flexible with a dynamic work schedule.12. Should be comfortable with wearing multiple hats, as the profile requires you to be the jack of many trades (if not all) and master of some.13. Should be fun and funny to prevent going insane. Being aware of memes is a must.14. Should know where to take things personally, and where to let it go.15. Should order in food for teammates (and shamelessly ask for treats, too) from time to time.That's all.

Someone who fits in the below story.Case in point -> A fast-growing startup comes up with a requirement of a website developer with an eye for details on the visual appeal as well. The firm also has a small use case for an internal web app.Inquiry -> Why can't we have one professional who is well versed in both web design and development? (Pro Level 8/10 in both).Email/letter sent by that fictional character/ Web champion to me :Hey Anand,Great call on the requirements of your project.Let's just say, what you need! - I get it.- WordPress, Webflow, Bubble, HTML, CSS, JS, Canva, Envato, Vectary, etc. are all the tools of the trade for me, just like Powerpoint, Word, Excel, and Notion are for you. It's given that I know these at an expert level. And come on, if I will get stuck, I will youtube it and elevate my level in an hour.- I don't need any graphics designer, video editor, or creative professional to work for me. I am a frontend expert, which means that I am responsible for the outside facade of your product, including the design and tech, be it a website or a quick web app you need (Bubble, Airtable ahem ahem !). Also, in the world of Canva, Envato, and Quick Youtube tutorials on Adobe Illustrator, Figma, and Photoshop, this won't be a major issue.- I get it. I do - really trust me I do get it! The fact every professional needs 10,000 hours to level up the basic skills to a Fully Operational level. But, I am just working for this one product with these 10 requirements defined by you. For these, I don't have to take 20 hrs courses, work for 4 months on a particular skill, etc etc. I know what's needed for this micro case, and would perhaps need maybe 2 days to ramp up my design or tech skills.- In the end, you give me a quick project of a website or an internal web app. I am going to (a) setup your database schema (on G-sheets, Airtable, or heck ya even SQL), (b) going to finalize the right tech for you (Webflow, WordPress, HTML via Dreamweaver of course, Bubble, or anything else), (c) going to shortlist the design tool (Canva as P#1, or if needed maybe use Envato Elements templates, or Vectary for some particular use case you have).And now, please for God's sake, allow me to get back to your work! See you in 7 days with your final product.Yours truly,Your Web-Side Champ (not website FYI)My response to this:This all sounds good. Let's start! But, btw where are you? Can you ping me back on this post?#design#webdesign#frontend#nocode"
