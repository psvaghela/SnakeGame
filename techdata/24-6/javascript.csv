Shubham Mishra,Specialty DPS Presales at DellEMC - Global Accounts,"Over this week I had the pleasure of having zoom meetings with two different DBAs and they both were from different Database 'universes'. One of them was a savant in AWS Dynamo DB and told me the beauty of the product in a way you can only explain when you love what you do. The other gentleman is a MongoDB Guru he shared with me the flexibility of MongoDB across consumption models, by the way the meeting with both was to talk about how Dell Data Protection can help them achieve where native tools fail. That being said, I have condensed the conversation in below writeup, its amazing how much more you can learn with passionate people, rather than reading documentation at days.PS - if you are a DB admin, please show some love and mention in comments which DB you use and for what use case and above all how do you protect it.#database#aws#mongodb#mongodbatlas#dynamodb#dataprotection"

To all Ukrainians, my colleagues, and friends I hope you and your loved ones are safe from harm, my thoughts are with you.Indeed,  these last 18 years with Novactive were an adventure!

I have so many memories, stories and so many good people that I met. I wrote a more detailed story here for the most curious/nostalgic of you.I had a blast, it was fun, and I built such a great experience, thanks to all the collaborators, the partners, and the customers who trusted me and worked with me.The time has finally arrived, I am switching to the “product” side!  Tomorrow, I am the CTO of a super-fast, super-modern, super-sexy, and super-powerful ""Headless eCommerce"" namedCrystallizeI am looking forward to achieving great success with them, the product is amazing and to build such a product they have a talented team that I am proud to join and eager to meet.Stay tuned!
