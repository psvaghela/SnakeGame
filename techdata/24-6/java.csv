We avoid paper. Moreover, we automate and digitize CFO's back officeWe all at Kapittx are excited to move to our own office. Our approach was very clear - ""Employee Safety First""Instead of opting for a co-working set-up, we decided to lease our own officeIt gives us a safety net against CovidCreates an easy transition from work from home setupIt gives us the home comforts we are habituatedEvery Kapittxer enthusiasm was at a different level.
