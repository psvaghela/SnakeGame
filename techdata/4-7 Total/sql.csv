What should I look for?”.In a role that’s expected to wear many hats and be a jack of all trades, don’t fall into the trap of hiring (or being) a master of none.Having been both a#productmarketingmanagerand#productmarketingleader, I’ve built high-performing PMM teams at three B2B unicorns. I made some great hires and some not-so-great hires along the way. 😅With some wins and many mistakes to learn from, here are the top 10 traits that I've seen consistently separate the best#productmarketingmanager's from the rest:1. They are exceptional communicators2. They are genuinely curious3. They are a trusted partner to product4. They are incredible storytellers5. They are natural collaborators6. They are analytically savvy7. They think full-funnel8. They crave outcomes over output9. They have deep empathy for the customer10. They ensure you build what you sell and sell what you build💡 Check out the linked post for more detail on each.These are just my own opinions based on what I've learned building and growing#productmarketingteams atAtlassian,Intercom, and most recently,Loom.There are of course many flavours of product marketing based on the specific needs and stage of the product and business.
