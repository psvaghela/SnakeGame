Depending on which statistics you look at, the number increased by upwards of 300%1 (or more) over 2020. In fact, many in the cybersecurity world call 2021 “the year of the software supply chain attack”. This is due in large part to the well-known SolarWinds nation-state attack which impacted thousands of enterprises and government agencies.If you think this does not have any implications for your business, please read my piece below on software supply chain attacks. The rise of hybrid workforces and cloud migrations has thrust every organization into the practice of software development because of need—which, in turn, gives bad actors more opportunities to do damage to your reputations, processes and data.If you have any questions about this article or how Cohere can best help you stay operational, safe and compliant, I invite you to reach out.

Wang Y.,Business and Technology Transformation Professional and Writer: I help organisations transform their business and technology and I share strategies for helping you get things done,"The Proximity Principle by Ken Coleman is a strategy for how you can get to a career you love.For example, if you wanted to get into high tech, you would want to move to a place like Silicon Valley or Austin Texas or even Boston Massachussetts - these places are 'hubs' for tech companies and startups and being in the space means you are exposed to people and opportunities to get into high tech.The proximity principle is similar but takes it further, outlining the five kinds of people you need, the five places you should be in and the four practices you should have to help you get a career and job you love. In short, it's about being mindful and taking the initiative to get the job you love because not everyone (almost no one) is gifted their dream job.#career#people#networking#proximityprinciple#kencoleman",left_only
