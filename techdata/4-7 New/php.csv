The term ‘cloud-native’ really means that a specific approach was used while building the application.Specifically, cloud native applications are built around several small, self-contained services (referred to as ‘Microservices’) that are deployed on cloud infrastructure using containers. In summary, ‘cloud-native’ applications have the following characteristics:📌 Can be deployed to any type of cloud.📌 Take full advantage of cloud computing environments and scale up on demand, very fast.📌 Generally are composed of several ‘Microservices’, each providing a single business feature and communicating with each other via a well-defined set of APIs. These services, when combined, provide the application, its functionality.📌 Have an underlying infrastructure that supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which helps developers constantly add new features/functionality.📌 Make use of containers (such as Docker) to host the above services. Each container maintains resource isolation. It is these containers that provide a fast and easy way to provide additional services on demand.📌 Some way of managing the containers that host these services, the most popular being Kubernetes.FollowCloudnloud Tech Community#cloudnloud#AWS#linux#azure#ansible#docker#kubernetes#automation#jobs#fresher#jobseekers#tech#community#technology#career#cka#ckad#exam#software#microservices",left_only
