Preeti Gupta,SEO is what drives me everyday.,"What is AMP?Known as Accelerated Mobile Pages, it shows the stripped-down version of a page in the SERPs.When it was launched in 2016, everyone thought this was ""the next big thing"" because of how much it helps, but slowly the trend was out and nobody was talking about the same.‚ùì So how does AMP help websites?Mainly it had to do with speed. AMP cuts all the ""unnecessary"" elements from the page like ads, javascript, images, and more and only shows the main content. Because Google and users love the speed and fast loading of pages, marketers used them,‚ùì What are the disadvantages of using AMP pages?It can become difficult to implement if you don't use WordPress. You may need to get help from a developer.As the ads don't show up on the AMP pages, the revenue drops and you make less money.The content goes to the google cache server and the URL will redirect to the AMP version as well as you lose all the creative controls for the page.Many marketers say that they can't capture leads as all the downloadable assets and javascript elements get deleted.There are more cons than pros and that's why it's not the best strategy to implement.‚ùì Who should use AMP pages?You struggle with speed and after doing many things, you cant get your pages to speed up.If the majority of your traffic comes from mobile searches.If you want to capture leads, get revenue from Google ads, or have already a fast website then you may not need the AMP.This was a long one.Did you like it? then don't forget to like and comment.#amp#seo",left_only

Chandan Kala,Assisting Medical Practitioners in increasing their online presence,"By now you guys might have understood how important it is to have a good online presence so I won't discuss that. Today I am going to discuss whether to have your own team or to outsource it to a company.I agree that having your own team (employees) to manage your digital presence sounds more promising compared to outsoursing it to a company.Just like every decision has its own pros and cons, you should weigh the benefits and challenges before taking a decision.The benefit of having your own marketing team is that you will have people who will work only for you and be available every day to get things done for you. They will have better domain expertise because they will be constantly working with you. The cost will be less when you get the same amount of work done by a third party.Now let's discuss the challenges of having your own team. Having your own marketing team is a very costly, time and energy consuming affair. For eg, for your digital marketing team you will need a medical content writer, general content writer, designer, video editor, developer (someone expert in html/css/js or wordpress), someone to do on page seo, off page seo, local seo, paid marketing expert (google ads or facebook ads), manager to manage all of them, etc. and these all fields are interlinked, even if one of the person is on leave other work might get hamper so you need to have a back up as well. Now think the amount of salary, time and energy that will go in keeping that team. And let me tell you good employees don't come cheap.Now you might say we can have an all-rounder, who knows everything. First of all, it's very difficult to find that person. Suppose you find one, what will you do if he/she switches the job or is not able to continue because of some medical reason. Nowadays, every company is facing the challenge of employee retention, be it fortune 500 or a local vendor so think of that point as well.So now the choice is up to you. Think before you act.#digitalmarketing#healthcaremarketing#marketing",left_only

Hastimal Shah,üí° #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. üëâV2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"üö´ Don't Make These Mistakes If You Are a WordPress Developer üö´üìå Failing to optimize media‚úî Large, high-resolution images can be printed or cropped to be viewed at full scale without losing image quality. However, if uploaded directly to your WordPress media library, they will usually be stored as large and unoptimized images.üìå Ignoring the XML sitemap‚úî Sitemaps are essential on larger websites because they enable search engines to crawl all of your pages. Unfortunately, this crucial feature is not yet native to WordPress, so you must use a plugin.üìå Missing Updates‚úî In addition to patching performance, design, and usability issues, these updates also patch vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to access your website.üìå Installing poorly coded themes‚úî The reason is that invalid HTML can cause rendering issues, which affect both users and search engines. In addition, many themes load a ridiculous amount of scripts, images, fonts, and other types of files, making it difficult for your pages to load quickly.üìå Excessive plugin installation‚úî Adding functionality to WordPress is as simple as installing one or more plugins. But, such plugins often load a lot of scripts, CSS files, images, and fonts, further degrading speed and creating a poor user experience.üìå Neglecting security‚úî Despite all your efforts, your website can never be completely secure. Hardening your security, on the other hand, will deter the vast majority of hackers, except those explicitly targeting you.üìå Failing to perform backups regularly.‚úî You need to perform backups regularly. It is essential to have a website running smoothly. In addition to enabling you to roll back changes, it may also help you to quickly recover from a hack by restoring an older version of your site.üìå Eliminating the schema element.‚úî Search engines use schema to determine what your content is about, and how the entities within the content relate to each other. Schema may not directly affect ranking, but additional visual cues can lead to an increased clickthrough rate.üí° Conclusion üí°It's hard to stop WordPress Development mistakes.

Amol Firke,"We Build Beautiful Websites That Convert & Acquire Leads | Website Design, UI UX Design, Brand Design, Content Marketing, Email Marketing | Co-Founder of Think Big Digital","Before you update your WordPress plugins, you need to make a full site backup.I suggest using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus to handle this. It‚Äôs a pretty painless process.The primary reason developers update WordPress plugins might be for security issues.Making sure that your site is safe and secure should be your top priority. One of the biggest weaknesses in a WordPress site is its plugins.As amazing as they are, plugins can conflict with each other and your themes and developers often work tirelessly to patch vulnerabilities and update the plugins so that your site isn‚Äôt open to attack.Outdated plugins can have openings that can be compromised, so keeping them up to date is one of the top ways to keep your site online and running like it should.Do you take a backup before updating the plugins?---------------------------------------P.S.
