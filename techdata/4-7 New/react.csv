Rajdeep Sengupta,SDE Intern @DocuComb | 🇮🇳 Microsoft Imagine Cup India Finalist '22 l GSSOC'22 | Full stack Web Developer 📌| AWS ✨ | Learning DevOps⚡| Building @Clueless 🚀 | Loves to Play Chess,"Do you really need DSA to land an internship in a startup❓❓The simple and easy answer is NO❗But who am I to tell you?I cracked two internships in my first year of college itself and both of them in a start-up. And one of them being a US based start-up where I am currently working. 🧑‍💻And I have given around 10 -12 interviews till now. 😉But honestly speaking no one asked a single DSA question. 💥Let me tell you why? 💥Generally startups find people who can build stuff in real-life. They usually have a small team building some amazing product. They want a person who is already good at that tech they are working on. ✨Like if you are applying for a Frontend Developer role, they expect you to be really good at React and they also look for projects that you have built using React. 💻They will not hire a person who is really good in DSA but don’t have any experience with the tech stack they are using.There are companies like BlinkIt where there is no DSA round even for a DevOps engineer role. 🚀So is DSA a waste of time❓Absolutely NOT ! you should do DSA. But why? 🤔DSA help you build logic faster. It helps you to know what’s happening in the function under the hood. DSA actually trains you to think in different different ways. And there are many many advantages of doing DSA. 📈And for any Big Tech companies likeMicrosoft,Meta,Google, you need good knowledge of DSA to crack them. 🏢But why these big tech companies are hiring candidates on the basis of DSA when what they are doing is development?That is  a really big topic to talk about. Will talk about that in another post. 😴Till the do development do DSA and keep rocking! 👋 and followRajdeep Sengupta.#react#frontenddeveloper#devops#tech#google#microsoft#internship#internships#development#engineer#hiring#team#experience#people#startup#startups#help#building#like#projects#developerlife#developercommunity#dsa#cpp#dsacoding",left_only

"Allison Tsao, SPHR",Creating healthier workplace cultures and leadership that focuses on positive human experience,"I recently asked a few leaders what the most important leadership skill was to help them lead their organisations into the future.  (keen to get others thoughts in the comments here too).Change agility was the unanimous response, which got me thinking - what are the key skills we need to learn to build a strong foundation of change agility? and why is this so hard?The world of work has long celebrated and fostered linear ways of thinking and analysing problems and left brain ways of rationalising and sense-making. But what if we could expand beyond this to include circular thinking and right brain ways of sense making? These ""messier"" ways of interpreting the world around us leave a lot of untapped wisdom for us to discover - which offer organisations a more robust and effective way of problem solving in complexity.Read my latest ponderings on the topic.#complexity#leadership#changeagility#leadershipdevelopment",left_only
