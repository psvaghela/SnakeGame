Janaspandana,"1,683 followers","The late DevOps authority Robert Stroud said DevOps is all about ""fueling business transformation"" that encompasses people, process, and culture change. The most effective strategies for DevOps transformation focus on structural improvements that build community. A successful DevOps initiative requires a culture—or mindset—a change that brings greater collaboration between multiple teams—product, engineering, security, IT, operations, and so on—as well as automation to better achieve business goals.The future of DevOps will also bring a greater focus on optimizing the use of cloud technologies. The centralized nature of the cloud provides DevOps automation with a standard platform for testing, deployment, and production.And regardless of what advanced technologies the future brings, organizations will need to realize that DevOps is all about the journey and that the organization's DevOps-related goals and expectations will evolve over time.#cloud#security#engineering#people#culture#business#devops#testing#transformation#collaboration#community#future#mindset#change#structural#automation#businesstransformation#devops#devopsworld#devopsculture#devopstools#continuousimprovement#cicd#gitlab#jenkins#docker"
