Kushla Eganüê£ (She/Her),"Talent Advocate, Tech @ affix","I'm verrrrry damn proud to share some of the work behind our embedded partnership with99designsbyVistaon thisInternational Women's Day 2022. I wrote something about our experience hiring for gender diversity in tech with them -- it's long, but I reckon worth the read if you're in this space.#BreakTheBias‚ù§Ô∏è40% of the software engineers we've helped join as '99ers' over the last 18 months have been women, including 3 in senior leadership roles.¬†This didn‚Äôt happen by accident, rather by design. We undertook a deliberate diversity recruitment strategy, with a heck of a lot of effort, heart, vulnerability, curiosity & creativity from us all.I‚Äôm sharing our learnings and advice with you in the hope that it might inform your own strategies‚Ä¶ or simply give you hope that progress is possible! We aren't DEI experts ataffix(...yet!), but we sure as hell didn't let that stop us from learning and giving it a go. + there's nothing stopping you folks out there from having a crack too!The team at99designsare the real deal. I've *loved* being a part of their journey as an extension of their team. They are some of the most inclusive, humble, fun, + big hearted people you'll ever meet.You can check out their careers page here:https://lnkd.in/gBWdq7J"

Janaspandana,"1,683 followers","The late DevOps authority¬†Robert Stroud said DevOps is all about ""fueling business transformation""¬†that encompasses people, process, and culture change. The most effective strategies for DevOps transformation focus on structural improvements that build community. A successful DevOps initiative requires a culture‚Äîor mindset‚Äîa change that brings greater collaboration between multiple teams‚Äîproduct, engineering, security, IT, operations, and so on‚Äîas well as automation to better achieve business goals.The future of DevOps will also bring a greater focus on optimizing the use of cloud technologies. The centralized nature of the cloud provides DevOps automation with a standard platform for testing, deployment, and production.And regardless of what advanced technologies the future brings, organizations will need to realize that DevOps is all about the journey and that the organization's DevOps-related goals and expectations will evolve over time.#cloud#security#engineering#people#culture#business#devops#testing#transformation#collaboration#community#future#mindset#change#structural#automation#businesstransformation#devops#devopsworld#devopsculture#devopstools#continuousimprovement#cicd#gitlab#jenkins#docker"
