Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a¬†flowchart¬†rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability.

Preeti Gupta,SEO is what drives me everyday.,"What is AMP?Known as Accelerated Mobile Pages, it shows the stripped-down version of a page in the SERPs.When it was launched in 2016, everyone thought this was ""the next big thing"" because of how much it helps, but slowly the trend was out and nobody was talking about the same.‚ùì So how does AMP help websites?Mainly it had to do with speed. AMP cuts all the ""unnecessary"" elements from the page like ads, javascript, images, and more and only shows the main content. Because Google and users love the speed and fast loading of pages, marketers used them,‚ùì What are the disadvantages of using AMP pages?It can become difficult to implement if you don't use WordPress. You may need to get help from a developer.As the ads don't show up on the AMP pages, the revenue drops and you make less money.The content goes to the google cache server and the URL will redirect to the AMP version as well as you lose all the creative controls for the page.Many marketers say that they can't capture leads as all the downloadable assets and javascript elements get deleted.There are more cons than pros and that's why it's not the best strategy to implement.‚ùì Who should use AMP pages?You struggle with speed and after doing many things, you cant get your pages to speed up.If the majority of your traffic comes from mobile searches.If you want to capture leads, get revenue from Google ads, or have already a fast website then you may not need the AMP.This was a long one.Did you like it? then don't forget to like and comment.#amp#seo"

Sarang Pokhare (He/Him),Senior Digital Marketing Manager at Diamante Blockchain | IIM Calcutta | ICO & Crowdfunding | Email Marketing | Inbound & Demand Generation,"A content management system (CMS) is a platform that lets you easily create a website without relying heavily on custom-coded solutions. These easy-to-use website creation tools have exploded in popularity over the last 10+ years; in 2011 just 24% of websites utilized a CMS ‚Äì now that number is nearly 64%. Given their popularity, it‚Äôs no surprise that many folks grow to have an attachment to a particular type of CMS, especially agencies like us who end up creating hundreds of sites for our various clients.At a(m), we prefer to do our development in WordPress. It truly is the dominant player in the CMS game, as nearly 65% of all websites today are built on WordPress. Not only that, but WordPress accounts for a whopping 96% of all blog-based content management systems and powers 34.7% of the top 1 million websites on the web.So, why use WordPress as opposed to another content management system? As an agency, we have been developing in WordPress for a little over a decade. But, when you combine the experience of our entire development team, they have a staggering 40+ years worth of expertise in the CMS. These numbers alone make it our go-to platform, but it becomes even more evident as the leading choice when you see some of the great functionality it offers.Open SourceWe use the WordPress content management system because it allows us to self-host websites for our clients. Ultimately, a self-hosted system provides more functionality and flexibility than relying solely on someone else‚Äôs technology. We estimate that 50% of our clients, no matter how simple the website, have something unique about their business that they want to be represented on their website in a way that requires a custom coding solution. We need the flexibility of an open-source system to achieve this, which is why we consistently turn to WordPress.Personalized ThemeHere at a(m), we have created and maintained a proprietary, Underscores-based theme. From there, it‚Äôs modified and molded to fit our client‚Äôs needs. Starting from a base theme allows us to speed up the development process because we‚Äôre not starting from scratch. And, given that we‚Äôve been using our theme for years, we‚Äôre well-versed in what it contains and can easily add or remove certain elements to meet the needs of each client.Enhanced MarketabilityWe think about so much more than putting up your website and walking away. From search engine and conversion rate optimization efforts to ongoing marketing initiatives, these efforts require us to monitor the website and then make adjustments. This is significantly easier to achieve when we have free reign to install tracking codes, create custom backend workflows, and can quickly and easily create new landing pages. We‚Äôve found that even the most popular proprietary content management systems have limitations that prevent us from performing this marketing work exactly as we‚Äôd like to.So, we‚Äôve established why we think WordPress is wonde..."

Hastimal Shah,üí° #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. üëâV2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Wanna Secure your WordPress Website‚ùì Check Below Steps to Secure ‚ùóüîí Implement SSL Certificatesüîë Millions of websites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to protect their online transactions. A SSL certificate should be one of the first steps you take to secure your website. SSL certificates are available for purchase, but most hosting providers provide them for free.üîí Require & Use Strong Passwordsüîë As well as obtaining an SSL certificate, one of the first things you should do to protect your site is to use strong passwords for all your logins. If you use a familiar or easy-to-remember password, you put yourself, your users, and your website at risk. By strengthening your password, you reduce your chances of being hacked.üîí Enable Two-Factor Authentication for WP-Adminüîë For your WordPress website, enable two-factor authentication (2FA). With this authentication method, you need to enter a unique code in order to complete the login process, adding a second layer of security to WordPress' login page.üîí Limit Login Attemptsüîë You are allowed to make as many login attempts as you want with WordPress. The WordPress admin area is vulnerable to brute force attacks by hackers using different password combinations until they find the right one.üîí Install A Security Pluginüîë There are several great security plugins available for WordPress, and plugins are a great way to add features to your website.Adding a security plugin to your website can add extra layers of protection without much effort.üîí Keep WordPress Core Files Updatedüîë To maintain the security and stability of your site, you should keep your WordPress updated at all times. The WordPress core team releases an update once a security vulnerability is reported. It is likely that you are using a vulnerable version of WordPress if you aren't updating your website.üîí Pay Attention To Themes & Pluginsüîë In addition to keeping your WordPress core files updated, there are other areas where WordPress can be vulnerable that are not protected by core updates - for example, themes and plugins. Be sure to only install plugins and themes from reputable developers.üîí Run Frequent Backupsüîë Having a backup of your WordPress website and important files is one way to keep your website protected. You do not want to be left with no backup if something happens to your website.üîí Conclusionüîë Cyberattacks can take many forms, from malware injection to DDoS attacks. Due to the popularity of the WordPress CMS, WordPress websites are a frequent target for hackers. In order to protect their WordPress websites, WordPress website owners must know how to do so.#wordpress#security#malware#sslcertificate"
Suvam Sahoo,Your Go to WordPress Guy | Founder and CEO of Secure My WP,"If you‚Äôre building a site, if you‚Äôre a developer, or even if you‚Äôre a writer who writes articles about WordPress, you may find that you need to get a fresh install of WordPress every now and then to test different things from scratch.This can be time-consuming, especially if you need to do multiple fresh installs regularly.But you don't have to perform a full install every time you need a fresh install of WordPress!There‚Äôs a plugin called WP Reset that will let you reset WordPress as if it‚Äôs a fresh installation.To use this plugin, install it, then, go to Tools > WP Reset.Once you‚Äôre on the page, go to the Reset tab and scroll down to the very bottom. You will see a box where you need to type the word ‚Äúreset‚Äù to use the Reset Site button to reset your site.This will now reset your installation as if it‚Äôs a brand new installation of WP.This is different from WordPress‚Äôs built-in reinstall function, which reinstalls WordPress but keeps your site‚Äôs data intact.On the contrary, WP Reset resets your WordPress installation as if it‚Äôs a truly fresh install. Your username and password remain the same, but everything else is removed.Keep in mind that your wp-uploads folder retains the files in it (but they won‚Äôt show up in your site‚Äôs media library anymore). To fix that, use WP Reset‚Äôs Clean uploads Folder tool in the Tools tab.If you found this post helpful, please comment ""WP reset"".#wordpress"

Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a¬†flowchart¬†rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability. These platforms also generally have features that allow for experimenting, prototyping, testing and deployment.List Of Most Commonly Used LCNC Platforms :***Open Source Platforms***-Budibase-Huginn-WordPress-Node-RED Brasil-PyCaret***Paid Platforms***-Appian Corporation- Google AppSheet-Mendix- Microsoft PowerApps-Salesforce Lightning-Sisense-Zoho Creator#lcnc#lowcode#nocode#lowcodenocode#lowcodeplatform#lowcodedevelopment#nocodeapps#budibase#microsoftpowerapps#huginn#revolutionary#future#wordpress#nodered#pycaret#appian#appiandeveloper#googleapps#mendix#salesforcelightning#zohocreator#development#opensource#coding#work#testing#environment#salesforce#softwaredevelopment"

Prathamesh Sakhadeo,WordPress Expert,"WordPress is not secure, and I don't want to build my website using WordPress.How many times you've heard this from a client?It's true that WordPress is a very popular technology to build websites, and is prone to attack from hackers.But, many times it's the developer's mistake that the website is vulnerable.It's a known fact that the username of WordPress should not be admin.But we are too lazy to give a different username.Let's not even talk about the password. They are so easy to guess that the hacker must be feeling unchallenged.Another point is using nulled plugins and themes. Your website is face of your business and it needs investment.That means sometimes you need to purchase premium themes and plugins.But to save the cost, many people opt for illegally obtained nulled plugins and themes.Many times these are infested with malware and malicious scripts.Another reason for poor security is outdated themes and plugins. WordPress like any other software needs maintenance and that means you need to update themes and plugins regularly.Installing plugins like WordFence and changing the login URL of WordPress also helps a lot.So, yes, WordPress is prone to attacks but you can make it secure.#wordpress#wordpresssecurity"

Nikhil Bhansali,"Youtuber, Video Marketer, Content Creator :)","No BS SEO guideSEO is trying to get yourself discovered by your customers searching about their problems and solutions. It can be on Google, Amazon, YouTube - whichever the search engine the basics are the same.2 words to summarise everything you need to know about SEO - Content and Distribution.Let's start with#distributionYou need a FAST website, so fast that You don't notice the time between clicking on link and opening the page. Choose a blogging platform which works well, after lot of testing I can suggest#superblog. If you're planning to use wordpress, make sure you have a developer resource full time to optimise your site constantly.Next you need to figure out what your clients are searching for. In the language they're searching for (crucial point many businesses ignore). You must have heard this a 100 times but priorities topic which is the intersection of- Good volume (100k+ searches for B2C, 1000+ searches for B2B monthly)- Low competition- Common senseThe difference between a good SEO expert and a great one is Common Sense first 2 bits are easy, third one is hard.After you complete the above research for distribution (which for a startup shouldn't take more than 8 hours) it's time to shift our focus to#contentI cannot emphasize this enough, do any black hat techniques, do whatever back linking, do any amount of SEO hacks none of it matters if your content is not excellent.Most companies spend 80-90% of their SEO#timeon things other than content. While it should be the other way around.There is no cure for bad content. You'll be surprised how many things you can get away with if you stop EVERYTHING ELSE and focus on just good content. Write compelling, thoughtful, well researched content and reap the benefits for YEARS. Your content should be so well written that you have to NEVER request for backlinks - they should come on their own.Do these 2 basics consistently and Keep Calm. Traffic will come.Don't splurge on expensive tools, consultants (when you're starting) and other guides. just follow the above steps.Any doubts let me know but this has worked for me time and again."

Amol Firke,"We Build Beautiful Websites That Convert & Acquire Leads | Website Design, UI UX Design, Brand Design, Content Marketing, Email Marketing | Co-Founder of Think Big Digital","Before you update your WordPress plugins, you need to make a full site backup.I suggest using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus to handle this. It‚Äôs a pretty painless process.The primary reason developers update WordPress plugins might be for security issues.Making sure that your site is safe and secure should be your top priority. One of the biggest weaknesses in a WordPress site is its plugins.As amazing as they are, plugins can conflict with each other and your themes and developers often work tirelessly to patch vulnerabilities and update the plugins so that your site isn‚Äôt open to attack.Outdated plugins can have openings that can be compromised, so keeping them up to date is one of the top ways to keep your site online and running like it should.Do you take a backup before updating the plugins?---------------------------------------P.S.

Know anyone who might be interested?CRAZY Software Developers (Fresher to 1 Year Max)Electronics For You Group is a tech media house, and we seek crazy software developers because we have a crazy IT environment.We need developers who would like to take on the challenge to work on different platforms, and shift many legacy applications to new technologies.Our legacy software was developed on Classic ASP. Then, some new tools got developed onASP.Net. We have quite a few websites on Wordpress, that need customisation and integration. Most of our applications are database centric, where the database is SQL Server. And, now we want to develop our own apps too.WE SEEK...We seek developers who understand that the value of a good algorithm is much more than the language or platform you are developing on.We seek developers who want to demonstrate their ability to handle mutiple platforms and code and develop excellent software.We seek developers who can switch from developing software onASP.netplatform to .PhP to Classic ASP to cloud native platforms.Yes, they will require a couple of days to read about the new encironments/languages, but they will be open to developing software on whichever platform we throw at them.KEY REQUIREMENTSWe need TWO such developers.We don't need any specific degree OR marks OR training certificates.Experience in CLASSIC ASP orASP.NETor .NET Core or WORDPRESS programming will be a bonus.Experience in jQuery, SQL Server will be a Super Bonus.You should be able to demonstrate your experience through contribution to an Open Source project, or a project developed for a client.We need YOU to have answered our basic Online Interview.We need YOU to be comfortable with a WORK FROM HOME arrangement OR be able to work out of our HQ (Okhla Phase 1 New Delhi).We will be singning a bond for 1 year.
