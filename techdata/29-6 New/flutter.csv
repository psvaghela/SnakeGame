"Merritt Quisumbing Anderson (she, her)",Mama x3 | Advisor | People & Culture Leader | Employment Lawyer | Investor | Fmr. GitHub,"I have never perfected my elevator pitch, but one nugget that I always bake in is that I’m a labor and employment attorney that moonlights as a people leader. The past three years I shifted focus a bit and became a consultant moonlighting as a people leader who also happens to be a labor and employment attorney. This shift was uncomfortable and confusing. I was not clear on my professional identity and frequently questioned my purpose, impact and efficacy when not functioning as a full-time operator inside of a name brand company.Today I shed doubt, fear and labels, and fully embrace my “new-ish role” as a founder and operator of a woman and minority owned consultancy,Merritt+ Consulting. A gig where I can be unapologetically and unabashedly me, bringing all of myself: experience, ideas, transparency, and passion - to founders, leaders and teams looking for a seasoned, deeply personal, people-obsessed, open-minded, communicator, and creative partner to design inclusive workplaces where people can thrive.No two people are the same and no two companies are the same. My approach is neither one-size fits all nor one-size fits most. Let’s dig in and build something together that sets your soul on fire, ignites passion and pride in your people, and is uniquely yours.The virtual shingle is out and I’m excited for what’s ahead. Check out where my passion lies and what you can expect when you partner with me here:https://lnkd.in/gqNGbZyi#employment#consulting#peopleandculture#peopleops#newgig#employeeexperience#representationmattersThis wouldn't be possible without support from the most incredibleElizabeth Wilson(thanks for pushing me to do the darn thing already) and to the many that inspire, support and challenge me on the regular.Brittany MoungerAileen LeeKelly WatkinsBarbara MessingRobin P.
