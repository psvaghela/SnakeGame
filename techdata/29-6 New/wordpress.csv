Amol Firke,"We Build Beautiful Websites That Convert & Acquire Leads | Website Design, UI UX Design, Brand Design, Content Marketing, Email Marketing | Co-Founder of Think Big Digital","Before you update your WordPress plugins, you need to make a full site backup.I suggest using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus to handle this. It‚Äôs a pretty painless process.The primary reason developers update WordPress plugins might be for security issues.Making sure that your site is safe and secure should be your top priority. One of the biggest weaknesses in a WordPress site is its plugins.As amazing as they are, plugins can conflict with each other and your themes and developers often work tirelessly to patch vulnerabilities and update the plugins so that your site isn‚Äôt open to attack.Outdated plugins can have openings that can be compromised, so keeping them up to date is one of the top ways to keep your site online and running like it should.Do you take a backup before updating the plugins?---------------------------------------P.S.

As a tech-heavy individual, my suggestions are somewhat biased towards the website's performance.Most businesses think having a website with legacy technology is perfect for their business and want to compete with the market leaders in that segment who are investing heavily in tech.As a techno-commercial , I know the value of the tech that has been used by market leaders and the kind of money they are investing in technology and talents.- We need the speed & user experience like 'X' website.- We need designs like the 'Y' website, and so on...There is no problem with reference points, but businesses need to understand the impact of achieving 'X' and 'Y.'I ask most of the time to early-stage founders to answer 3 questions:1. Is your business ready to compete with these 'X' & 'Y' market leaders in your segment?2. Do you have enough investment capital to keep the game on for this evolving tech competition?3. What will be the impact of this new-gen tech on your business?Unfortunately, 90% of the founders failed to justify the same, which is one of the significant problems of early-stage companies.So how to select the right technology and provide a top-notch user experience on a minimum budget?--> Early StageFor e-commerce -->#Shopify,#WooCommerceFor static websites -->#WordPress,#WebflowFor SaaS --> MERN Stack (Monolithic architecture)--> Growth StageFor e-commerce -->#HeadlessCommerceFor static websites -->#Jamstack,#HeadlessCMS(Growth Stage)For SaaS --> MERN Stack (#Monolithicarchitecture +#Microservices)--> EnterpriseFor e-commerce --> MACH CommerceFor static websites --> Jamstack, Headless CMS,#EdgeComputing,#DXPFor SaaS --> MERN Stack (Microservices, Cloud Agnostic) (Enterprise)If you are starting for the first time or in the growth stage, try to find the technology-problem fit first.
