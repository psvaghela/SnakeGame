Aarti Rathod,Providers of skilled developers on demand | We're Hiring IT Rockstars,"The main difference between C++and Java is that C++ is only a compiled language while Java is both compiled and interpreted. The C++ compiler converts the source code into machine code and therefore. it is platform dependent. When it comes to system programming and/for other low-level applications. C++ is more powerful. Some people might argue that having automatic GC collections, no pointers, no multiple inheritances make Java more powerful. But when it comes to speed C++ is  powerful.We at#nimapinfotechwith team of 400+experienced#developersoffers dedicated manpower services all around the globe. with more than 12+ year of experience in the#businesswe can offer 24//7 ready-to-deploy resources in all technologies.ùêÇùê®ùêßùêßùêûùêúùê≠ ùêÆùê¨ ùê≠ùê°ùê´ùê®ùêÆùê†ùê° ùê≠ùê°ùê¢ùê¨ ùê•ùê¢ùêßùê§-https://lnkd.in/dSDtbUf#team#experience#people#programming#language#java#informationsecurity#informationtechnology#technology#computer#coding#like#share#services#C++#javascript",left_only
