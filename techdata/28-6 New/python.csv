The term ‘cloud-native’ really means that a specific approach was used while building the application.Specifically, cloud native applications are built around several small, self-contained services (referred to as ‘Microservices’) that are deployed on cloud infrastructure using containers. In summary, ‘cloud-native’ applications have the following characteristics:📌 Can be deployed to any type of cloud.📌 Take full advantage of cloud computing environments and scale up on demand, very fast.📌 Generally are composed of several ‘Microservices’, each providing a single business feature and communicating with each other via a well-defined set of APIs. These services, when combined, provide the application, its functionality.📌 Have an underlying infrastructure that supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which helps developers constantly add new features/functionality.📌 Make use of containers (such as Docker) to host the above services. Each container maintains resource isolation. It is these containers that provide a fast and easy way to provide additional services on demand.📌 Some way of managing the containers that host these services, the most popular being Kubernetes.FollowCloudnloud Tech Community#cloudnloud#AWS#linux#azure#ansible#docker#kubernetes#automation#jobs#fresher#jobseekers#tech#community#technology#career#cka#ckad#exam#software#microservices",left_only

Jinesh Shah,SWE III at Google | Ex-Microsoft | Blogger | OMSCS at Georgia Tech | Creator of Caption AI,"A while back, I went on a 120 - day long job search journey, aced more than 30 interviews, and landed multiple offers. I am writing this article to help others do the same and land their dream job. My goal with this article was to create a blueprint and a roadmap that can be followed by any candidate on their next job search.Though there’s a lot of information about interviewing, some of the critical details are missing. Details like communicating your story, communicating your level through system design, or negotiating the offer when the time comes. This is what my article addresses well.I have spent 30+ hours drafting, editing and polishing this post and it is a sum total of my learnings, tricks and all the resources I used.I request my network to make sure this guide reaches anyone who is on or about to be on a SWE job hunt. To do this feel free to tag your friends or share it with them over DM.I am also looking forward to hearing any feedback or notes you have to improve this guide.[Author’s Note: The article is at nearly 5,000 words, so you probably don’t want to try reading this on a mobile device.
