Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Why WordPress Website Needed the Care Plan❓📍 A WordPress care plan is a package designed specifically for a WordPress website. You might know these care plans by the name WordPress maintenance plans, support plans, or wp maintenance plans. They're all the same!✍ Enhanced Website Security📍 When it comes to websites, security is the one factor you should never compromise on. You can lose everything once there's a website security breach. In a WordPress web care plan, you get reputed security plugins for free.✍ Maximum Performance Benefits📍 WordPress developers continuously strive to make things faster. With every WordPress update, several performance and speed improvements are released along with new features added to the software. Needless to say, speed and user experience are two huge factors to retain traffic to your website.✍ Keep Your Website Fresh📍 You can regularly update your website content according to the evolving visitor demands and trends in your niche. Moreover, the freshness factor plays a crucial role in driving organic traffic to your website. Both the search engines and users favor a freshly updated website.✍ Time-Saving Investment📍 It takes too much time and energy to build a website from scratch, let alone maintain it monthly. You should work towards growing your business rather than tinkering with technicalities. Leave that to the professionals and focus on doing what you're good at.✍ Prevention Is Cheaper Than Cure📍 Website maintenance is an integral part of the entire web development life cycle. Overlooking this aspect could cost you big bucks, or even worse, critical data loss. Even restoring an old backup could mean irrecoverable loss of recent content updates, sales orders, and contact information database – something which could have been avoided altogether with regular website maintenance.✍ Looking For WordPress Care Plan?📍 WordPress care plans ensure that your website is secure and ready to attract prospects every second of every day. So to get the most out of your website and grow your business online, contact us today.#wordpresswebsite#woocommerce#wordpress#business#webdevelopment#security#maintenance#searchengines#performanceV2 Web Solutions",,,left_only

Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a flowchart rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability.

Sarang Pokhare (IIM Calcutta Alumni),"Senior Digital Marketing Manager @ Diamante Blockchain | IIM Calcutta | Inbound, PPC & Email Marketing | ICO & Crowdfunding Marketing","Reflections about low-code data managementhttps://ift.tt/i6g3YaJYou wouldn’t code a website from scratch, so why would you code your corporate data estate from scratch? As it turns out, data engineers and business intelligence professionals can learn a great deal from the history of website development to help us with managing our corporate data estate.In the early days of the Internet, websites were developed from scratch using coding languages like HTML and CSS. This was a complex process that often required a team of web designers and developers, a complex stack of tools, and months of development time.There were actually a number of advantages to building a website this way:Design Precision: It allowed for complete control over the design of the website.Customization: It meant that the website could be customized to a very specific set of requirements.Hosting & Storage: It gave the website owner complete control over the hosting, storage, and migration of the website.But on the flipside, there were several drawbacks of developing a website from scratch:Expensive: It was very time-consuming and expensive.Highly-technical: It required a lot of technical knowledge and skills (which are hard to staff for, especially with the talent shortages organizations continue to struggle with).Error-prone: It is prone to errors and coding mistakes that can be very difficult to track down and fix.The Shift to Low-code Website DevelopmentAs more people began using the Internet, better tools and resources became available. Today, the market is full of low-code Content Management Systems (CMS) and drag-and-drop website builders (WordPress, HubSpot, Shopify, Squarespace, etc.) that make it easy to create a professional-looking website without any coding knowledge.While there are still a handful of very specific use cases where you would need to code a website from scratch, organizations realized that using a low-code CMS or drag-and-drop builder was a much better option in the vast majority of cases.This shift has led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of time and effort required to build a website. In fact, you can now create an entire website in just a few hours using these low-code tools.With every great shift comes some level of resistance. At first, web developers were skeptical of (or outright opposed to) low-code tools for the following reasons:Fear of Replacement: Developers saw these tools as a threat to their jobs.Power & Flexibility: Developers were unconvinced that they would be powerful, flexible, or customizable enough to produce the same quality of work.Trust & Reliability: Since the code was generated automatically, developers were unsure that it could be trusted to the same degree as the code they wrote themselves.But over time, most developers came to realize that these fears were unfounded and that these tools were not a replacement for their skills but rather a complement.The benefits beca...",,,left_only

Nihal Ahmed,SDE-1 at Masai School,"I used to create websites with WordPress themes. But that wasn't enough so I joinedMasai SchoolAfter school and pre-university college, I took up engineering in computer science, a step towards my goal of becoming a 'pro' at computers and eventually a cybersecurity expert.After graduating, I realized I didn't have the skills required to work at a cybersecurity firm and realized that I should first know how to develop software on the Internet before I protect people from breaking down/securing them from bad actors.I joined a small startup as a web developer to begin my developer journey and the work there mostly involved building sites using ready made WordPress themes. I was curious to know how to actually build websites from start to end without using these readily available themes. I started researching a bit and learnt that I need to skill up and understand tech stacks like LAMP & MERN.I was trying to learn it all from the Internet and didn't know where to even start. Fortunately, one evening when I was browsing, I came across an article onYourStory Mediawhich talked about a military-style coding school in Bangalore. I was very undisciplined and so military style education is just what I needed. My discipline took a 180-degree turn after I enrolled at Masai school. The person who used to wake up late and rush to his job at 9:30 am, was here, waking up early in the morning and rushing to the campus, to complete the pending rigorous assignments.One difference I noticed between when I was trying to learn things on my own and after enrolling into Masai was that I didn't have the discipline, the right direction, quality and quantity that I should focus on when I was learning on my own. The Internet has a vast amount of information but without discipline and right direction, I believe it is difficult to reach your destination on time. The funny thing is I thought I knew HTML until I learnt it at Masai. I enjoyed learning at Masai and the collaboration with my peers. Also the amazing team at Masai who was always available to guide me in the right direction but never spoon-feed us!I am happy to say that I was selected as an IA at Masai even before completing the last unit of the course, and am now promoted to SDE-1. The salary is 10x times my previous salary!#masaischool#coding#softwaredeveloper#webdeveloper#wordpress#sde1",,,left_only
