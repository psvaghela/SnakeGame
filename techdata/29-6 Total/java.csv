Aarti Rathod,Providers of skilled developers on demand | We're Hiring IT Rockstars,"The main difference between C++and Java is that C++ is only a compiled language while Java is both compiled and interpreted. The C++ compiler converts the source code into machine code and therefore. it is platform dependent. When it comes to system programming and/for other low-level applications. C++ is more powerful. Some people might argue that having automatic GC collections, no pointers, no multiple inheritances make Java more powerful.
