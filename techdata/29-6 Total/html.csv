My article (also to be published shortly in Law360) answers that question.In short, Fintech lawyers should step-up and become the first lines of defense against the perilous Web3 fraud expounded by the signatories of The Letter.¬†Fintech lawyers must take extra precautions so as not to become fraud facilitators and enablers and not to lose their way amid the spectacular fee opportunities associated with Web3.The Letter makes clear that the time is now for a sea-change. For fintech lawyers, this is not¬†just a matter of doing what is right, it may also be a matter of self-preservation. Reading between the lines, The Letter puts fintech lawyers on notice that when things go south, lawyers could become perfect targets for culpability, including for malpractice suits, regulatory enforcement actions and even criminal prosecutions."
