Jake Donziger,Founder of Blazr Consulting | 16 Years Old,"When discussing the boarding (and general independent school model) with individuals who have or are currently being educated by public schools, I frequently hear a set of combative statements and questions in response to my enthusiasm and admiration of the boarding and independent school community. Among these, the most common question seems to be “but doesn’t the immense pressure to perform inhibit the high school experience?”This notion is the unfortunate product of fictional media & entertainment, and is by no means indicative of the realistic and modern independent school experience.In hopes of providing an alternative narrative in support of the boarding school model and its communities, I have constructed an article titled “Boarding Schools and Achievement: A Counter Argument to Adversaries.”--"
Mike Ducker,Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Builder,Going to start sharing articles related to the book I am working on.

John Reed Stark,"President, John Reed Stark Consulting | Former Chief, SEC Office of Internet Enforcement | First in Incident Response","Eminent author and technologist Cory Doctorow once noted wryly that the Venn intersection of ""people who code"" and ""people who understand finance"" is so small (cover your ears kids) it's a sphincter.https://lnkd.in/gkPuTccnThat's why I heed the warnings of seasoned experts like the 1500+ independent and objective technologist signatories of the recentconcerned.techletter deriding Web3 and calling it all out as bunk.But what does The Letter mean for fintech lawyers, consultants and other Web3 enablers? My article (also to be published shortly in Law360) answers that question.In short, Fintech lawyers should step-up and become the first lines of defense against the perilous Web3 fraud expounded by the signatories of The Letter. Fintech lawyers must take extra precautions so as not to become fraud facilitators and enablers and not to lose their way amid the spectacular fee opportunities associated with Web3.The Letter makes clear that the time is now for a sea-change. For fintech lawyers, this is not just a matter of doing what is right, it may also be a matter of self-preservation. Reading between the lines, The Letter puts fintech lawyers on notice that when things go south, lawyers could become perfect targets for culpability, including for malpractice suits, regulatory enforcement actions and even criminal prosecutions."

Kristen Fife (she/her/hers),Senior Technical Recruiter (Purple Squirrel Hunter) - Twitter,"Job seekers: when you upload your resume to an ATS system, recruiters see it. An image of your resume is attached to your application. There is nothing “compliant” about it- ie meaning if you don’t do it THIS WAY your resume won’t be seen. It’s bunk, a myth. The alternate term, “optimized”, is more accurate. BUT - it still has NOTHING to do with whether or not a recruiter sees your resume…it refers to whether or not the the ATS can parse (scan) your resume to autopopulate fields so you don’t need to manually fill them in. And the basic “trick” for this is to not use columns, icons, tables and graphs. Stick to a traditional format.#IcallATSBS#asktheexperts#jobsearchtips#jobsearchstrategies#resumewriting#resumetips#resumehelp#resume#resumes#askarecruiter#jobseekerguardians#recruiters#recruiter#jobseekers"
