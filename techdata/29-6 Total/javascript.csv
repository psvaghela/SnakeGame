They cost 5€. You take out of your pocket 5€ in paper money and hand it over to the merchant. They put it in their cashier and move on to the next customer.Later that day, the merchant heads to the bank to deposit 💵 their money and your 5€ paper money is being rejected by the bank. They say It's a fake 5€. It looks like one but It's not one.The merchant buys a money checker to avoid such things to happen again.This is the story of JavaScript versus TypeScript.
