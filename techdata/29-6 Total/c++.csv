GURUBALAN C,Helping businesses in developing world-class technology teams | Recruitment Consultant at Antal International Network,"Most candidates are worth your trust.One of my candidates joined my client today for the position of software developer, this was heartening for 2 reasons one was because he stuck to his commitment and secondly as a recruiter, I could find him an opportunity as he was returning to employment.When we first started talking, he was eager to find work because he had been out of a job for the previous two years because of his decision to pursue higher education abroad. However, COVID caused disruption to his plans for 2 years and finally when he was to fly out, he tragically lost his father to the pandemic.Financial hardship was next and hence he decided to look for a job and he approached Antal and I was his recruitment partner. We went through the process in detail and I could understand his skills and experience.Interviews followed and within 2 to 3 weeks we had the offer out and he joined this week.When I look back, what gave me confidence was his skills and eagerness to start work where he was needed. Getting him interviewed and helping him select an offer was easier as there was trust both ways.𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗜 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗴𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝗻 𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗵.If you really looking for career advancement and can be trusted in a partnership,  please write to me atgurubalan.c@antal.com#career#interview#jobopportunity#covid#job#work#successstories#change#hiringtalent#hiring#placement#success#successfulplacement#recruitment#trust#partnership"

The next day that CFO said he couldn’t sleep, that he went in early to extrapolate numbers and determined turnover was their second biggest cost.
