Almost every founder I talk to lists finding the “right” people to hire as one of their biggest challenges.Why? Are there not enough talented candidates out there? Or is it a question of “cultural fit”?According to Inc Magazine’s 2020 CEO Survey, 34% of candidates are not a “cultural fit”. Why do I keep putting that in quotes?Because, really what does that mean?

Sabine Mueller,"CEO DHL Consulting, EVP","How do you get more diversity in the C-suite? By fixing corporate culture – not people. Too often, women’s leadership development programs send the message that women need to ‘fix’ themselves in order to be ready for a senior role. I have gone through these coaching programs myself. I’ve been taught how to sit, how to stand, and how to adjust my voice in order to be successful.Here’s what I know now: Developing good leaders is not about fixing them. It’s about building a new work culture that fosters a variety of leadership styles in which diverse racial, ethnic, and gender identities are considered as professional as the prevailing model.In fact, the future depends on it. Time and again, leadership diversity is shown to be a critical success factor in a company’s economic performance. Yet, there’s been a frustrating lack of diversity progress in German companies. The share of women sitting on DAX 40 company boards is just 17%. It’s not just about gender either. There’s also little to no representation from individuals of differing social or cultural origins, sexual orientations, gender identities, or physical ability.Here are my three key recommendations to focus on fixing corporate culture and letting people flourish.

Heather Dranitsaris-Hilliard,LEADERSHIP EXPERT for organizations frustrated with behavior. Leadership training & solutions. Author & Keynote Speaker,"There are many reasons why it is challenging to work for leaders with a narcissistic self-protective persona at the best of times. They are image-driven, with a need to have others treat them as though they are competent and amazing leaders at all times, despite the reality of their actual competence.Faced with their inexperience with leading during a crisis, anyone with this leadership persona has doubled down on their usual self-protective behaviors, causing employees to shut up for fear of bearing the wrath their boss.#narcissisticleaders#narcissists#leadershippersona#narcissismatwork#tipsforemployees"
