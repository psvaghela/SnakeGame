Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a¬†flowchart¬†rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability. These platforms also generally have features that allow for experimenting, prototyping, testing and deployment.List Of Most Commonly Used LCNC Platforms :***Open Source Platforms***-Budibase-Huginn-WordPress-Node-RED Brasil-PyCaret***Paid Platforms***-Appian Corporation- Google AppSheet-Mendix- Microsoft PowerApps-Salesforce Lightning-Sisense-Zoho Creator#lcnc#lowcode#nocode#lowcodenocode#lowcodeplatform#lowcodedevelopment#nocodeapps#budibase#microsoftpowerapps#huginn#revolutionary#future#wordpress#nodered#pycaret#appian#appiandeveloper#googleapps#mendix#salesforcelightning#zohocreator#development#opensource#coding#work#testing#environment#salesforce#softwaredevelopment"

Hastimal Shah,üí° #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. üëâV2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Why WordPress Website Needed the Care Plan‚ùìüìç A WordPress care plan is a package designed specifically for a WordPress website. You might know these care plans by the name WordPress maintenance plans, support plans, or wp maintenance plans. They're all the same!‚úç Enhanced Website Securityüìç When it comes to websites, security is the one factor you should never compromise on. You can lose everything once there's a website security breach. In a WordPress web care plan, you get reputed security plugins for free.‚úç Maximum Performance Benefitsüìç WordPress developers continuously strive to make things faster. With every WordPress update, several performance and speed improvements are released along with new features added to the software. Needless to say, speed and user experience are two huge factors to retain traffic to your website.‚úç Keep Your Website Freshüìç You can regularly update your website content according to the evolving visitor demands and trends in your niche. Moreover, the freshness factor plays a crucial role in driving organic traffic to your website. Both the search engines and users favor a freshly updated website.‚úç Time-Saving Investmentüìç It takes too much time and energy to build a website from scratch, let alone maintain it monthly. You should work towards growing your business rather than tinkering with technicalities. Leave that to the professionals and focus on doing what you're good at.‚úç Prevention Is Cheaper Than Cureüìç Website maintenance is an integral part of the entire web development life cycle. Overlooking this aspect could cost you big bucks, or even worse, critical data loss. Even restoring an old backup could mean irrecoverable loss of recent content updates, sales orders, and contact information database ‚Äì something which could have been avoided altogether with regular website maintenance.‚úç Looking For WordPress Care Plan?üìç WordPress care plans ensure that your website is secure and ready to attract prospects every second of every day.

Nikhil Bhansali,"Youtuber, Video Marketer, Content Creator :)","No BS SEO guideSEO is trying to get yourself discovered by your customers searching about their problems and solutions. It can be on Google, Amazon, YouTube - whichever the search engine the basics are the same.2 words to summarise everything you need to know about SEO - Content and Distribution.Let's start with#distributionYou need a FAST website, so fast that You don't notice the time between clicking on link and opening the page. Choose a blogging platform which works well, after lot of testing I can suggest#superblog. If you're planning to use wordpress, make sure you have a developer resource full time to optimise your site constantly.Next you need to figure out what your clients are searching for. In the language they're searching for (crucial point many businesses ignore). You must have heard this a 100 times but priorities topic which is the intersection of- Good volume (100k+ searches for B2C, 1000+ searches for B2B monthly)- Low competition- Common senseThe difference between a good SEO expert and a great one is Common Sense first 2 bits are easy, third one is hard.After you complete the above research for distribution (which for a startup shouldn't take more than 8 hours) it's time to shift our focus to#contentI cannot emphasize this enough, do any black hat techniques, do whatever back linking, do any amount of SEO hacks none of it matters if your content is not excellent.Most companies spend 80-90% of their SEO#timeon things other than content. While it should be the other way around.There is no cure for bad content. You'll be surprised how many things you can get away with if you stop EVERYTHING ELSE and focus on just good content. Write compelling, thoughtful, well researched content and reap the benefits for YEARS. Your content should be so well written that you have to NEVER request for backlinks - they should come on their own.Do these 2 basics consistently and Keep Calm. Traffic will come.Don't splurge on expensive tools, consultants (when you're starting) and other guides. just follow the above steps.Any doubts let me know but this has worked for me time and again."

Amol Firke,"We Build Beautiful Websites That Convert & Acquire Leads | Website Design, UI UX Design, Brand Design, Content Marketing, Email Marketing | Co-Founder of Think Big Digital","Before you update your WordPress plugins, you need to make a full site backup.I suggest using a plugin such as UpdraftPlus to handle this. It‚Äôs a pretty painless process.The primary reason developers update WordPress plugins might be for security issues.Making sure that your site is safe and secure should be your top priority. One of the biggest weaknesses in a WordPress site is its plugins.As amazing as they are, plugins can conflict with each other and your themes and developers often work tirelessly to patch vulnerabilities and update the plugins so that your site isn‚Äôt open to attack.Outdated plugins can have openings that can be compromised, so keeping them up to date is one of the top ways to keep your site online and running like it should.Do you take a backup before updating the plugins?---------------------------------------P.S.

Is your business ready to compete with these 'X' & 'Y' market leaders in your segment?2. Do you have enough investment capital to keep the game on for this evolving tech competition?3. What will be the impact of this new-gen tech on your business?Unfortunately, 90% of the founders failed to justify the same, which is one of the significant problems of early-stage companies.So how to select the right technology and provide a top-notch user experience on a minimum budget?--> Early StageFor e-commerce -->#Shopify,#WooCommerceFor static websites -->#WordPress,#WebflowFor SaaS --> MERN Stack (Monolithic architecture)--> Growth StageFor e-commerce -->#HeadlessCommerceFor static websites -->#Jamstack,#HeadlessCMS(Growth Stage)For SaaS --> MERN Stack (#Monolithicarchitecture +#Microservices)--> EnterpriseFor e-commerce --> MACH CommerceFor static websites --> Jamstack, Headless CMS,#EdgeComputing,#DXPFor SaaS --> MERN Stack (Microservices, Cloud Agnostic) (Enterprise)If you are starting for the first time or in the growth stage, try to find the technology-problem fit first.
