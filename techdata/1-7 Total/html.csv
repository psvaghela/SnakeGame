Collins is a vice president atJobs for the Future (JFF)and in a 2022 CNBC interview he said, “we cannot ignore the systemic barriers to access and advancement that begin in K-12 schools and persist in communities and in the workplace.

The phrase was popularised with a song, as people, particularly women in Western countries, looked forward to relative freedom from work and childcare, helped by gadgets such washing machines and vacuum cleaners.But things have changed. This generation is likely to live to 100 and the most enjoyable, and productive, chapter of life could be well after 50. Rather than ageing being seen as a problem, let's acknowledge the 'suss' that people develop in half a century.

Design Relax,"1,008 followers","Seven tips to increase your email marketing sales, avoiding being a spammer.Opt-inyour mailing list must have to be full of clients that have been accepted to receive your advertisements by filling up a form on your website.Opt-outIt is mandatory to put in the head or in the footer of your HTML the sentence ”If you don’t want to receive our messages anymore, please click here” and the link will instantly remove that client from your list.Hire a specialized company to send your emails.They will assure your campaign will be delivered in the correct way.Divide your mailing listJust in case you have a very big email database with, for example, 200.000 users by instance, divide it into small lists with 25.000 people. It will speed up your shipment and avoid any freezing.Write correctly the titleKeep away from words like promo, discount, low prices, etc. The servers are smart enough to identify these words and block your shipment.HTML mannersSome digital marketing specialists are saying that is worthy to use “_” in the title of the HTML file (not in the email’s subject) for instance if your subject is “We are launching new courses” your HTML’s title must need to be “We_are_lauching_new_courses”Use your FTP wisely.Even though the FTP would influence your email marketing results, you should create an “arbitrary” name for the folder that you will save your email marketing’s content, steer clear of names like newsletter, email, email marketing, campaigns, etc.Check this article out to see the complete explanationRafael Basso#digitalmarketing#emailmarketing#uxdesign#email#designrelax"

☁️ Christophe Foulon 🎯,vCISO | Strategic Leader | Digital Transformations Focused on Cybersecurity & Risk Mitigation | Strategic Business Development | Cyber Security Speaker | Cyber Information Security Office | CISSP GSLC CRISC AWS Security,"Reflections on a week with inspiring cybersecurity leadersHaving wrapped up the week at an onsite conference, I wanted to share some reflections from the Cyber Future Foundations Cyber Talent Week (https://lnkd.in/g63cPTxe). Thinking about the challenges we have in tackling the demand for cybersecurity talent to fill some of the millions of unfilled jobs, some focus areas emerged, and the solutions required all stakeholders to take part. To solve the talent-gap crisis facing the cybersecurity industry, we will need to take a multi-faceted approach from the employers, candidates, and the educational system that supports them. Based on the scale of the problem, I am going to break down the solutions into phases for the short-term, long-term, and next generation.#cybersecurity#cyber#future#leaders#share#jobs#talent#informationsecurity#advanceyourcybercareerCPF Coaching"

Most significant quote: “Not one single person who re-enters the office in the next three months is the same as the one who left.”Organizations need now more than ever to use Design Thinking tools to understand ‘how it feels to work here’ and how and where people are most productive. Don’t rely on a benchmark or outside study to dictate what is best for your people. Listen, build User Stories, gather qualitative as well as quantitative insights. Use personas rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Make sure you understand the problems before you ideate new solutions.These articles can give you an indication of key trends but there is no substitute for your own research. Leaders who can vocalize what matters to their people will gain trust and credibility.Happy reading!#people#wellness#leaders#designthinking#analytics#userexperience"

The research paper aims at divulging my opinions on various research questions including, inter alia,->  What is the effect of the Act on Indian Society?->  Whether the Act has fulfilled its purpose in Indian Society?->  Whether the Act is being implemented appropriately?->  Whether the implementation policies of the Central Government are efficacious?I would be highly obliged if you may be pleased to spare some time to read and share you opinions on the article and the issues in question.Thank you for reading this post!#society#research#law#lawstudent#lawyers#pocso#childsafety#childabuseprevention#supremecourt#advocates#legalknowledge#legaleducation#legalissues#curingtheills#change#societyandculture#indianlaw#india#indianstudents#indianculture#dpsp#constitutionofindia#constitutionallaw"
