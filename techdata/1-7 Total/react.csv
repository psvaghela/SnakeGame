"Kevin Ervin Kelley, AIA",Architect. Innovation Coach. Int'l Speaker. Dad.,"I've been lucky enough to meet most of my business heroes and fortunate to work with some extraordinary leaders. But seeing them at a conference, lecture, or public setting versus meeting them in their office is vastly different.While these leaders seem so put together and polished in public, once I see them inside their offices, they often look like a pack of wild animals are chasing them around the corridors. (BTW: I'm no different in my office!)In this latest edition of The Attention Architect, I will discuss what happens to leaders in their offices and three strategies for how you can help them manage the chaos of business.If you find this helpful article, please forward it to your colleagues.
