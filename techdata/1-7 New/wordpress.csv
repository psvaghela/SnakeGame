Harish Prajapati,Student | Keen Learner | WordPress Developer | Landing Page Designer | Content Creator,"Recently I read the book “THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MONEY” and some of the key lessons I learned from this book,I have mentioned below…Hope you like it and what you have learned from this book let me know in the comment section👇👇➡️LESS EGO MORE WEALTH:- Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, wealth is what you don't see.➡️NOTHING IS FREE IN THIS WORLD:-In order to make money initially you have to pay something that could be in the form of time or any other assets.➡️USE MONEY TO GAIN CONTROL OVER YOUR TIME:-If you have enough money then you can get time freedom by delegating your work to others, so you can focus on your primary goal.➡️BECOME लंबी RACE का घोड़ा:-Time is the most powerful force in the investing. It makes little things grow and big mistakes fade away.➡️RISK है तो इश्क है:-We should like risk because it pays off over the time. The term calculated risk matters here.I have learned many things from this book, But couldn't share everything so I summarised it in a short and sweet manner. I am a WordPress developer so if you need any help let me know...I will be there.THANKS FOR READING THIS POST🙂#wordpress#work#money#investing#psychology#booksummary#books#entrepreneur#books",left_only

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Wanna Secure your WordPress Website❓ Check Below Steps to Secure ❗🔒 Implement SSL Certificates🔑 Millions of websites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to protect their online transactions. A SSL certificate should be one of the first steps you take to secure your website. SSL certificates are available for purchase, but most hosting providers provide them for free.🔒 Require & Use Strong Passwords🔑 As well as obtaining an SSL certificate, one of the first things you should do to protect your site is to use strong passwords for all your logins. If you use a familiar or easy-to-remember password, you put yourself, your users, and your website at risk. By strengthening your password, you reduce your chances of being hacked.🔒 Enable Two-Factor Authentication for WP-Admin🔑 For your WordPress website, enable two-factor authentication (2FA). With this authentication method, you need to enter a unique code in order to complete the login process, adding a second layer of security to WordPress' login page.🔒 Limit Login Attempts🔑 You are allowed to make as many login attempts as you want with WordPress. The WordPress admin area is vulnerable to brute force attacks by hackers using different password combinations until they find the right one.🔒 Install A Security Plugin🔑 There are several great security plugins available for WordPress, and plugins are a great way to add features to your website.Adding a security plugin to your website can add extra layers of protection without much effort.🔒 Keep WordPress Core Files Updated🔑 To maintain the security and stability of your site, you should keep your WordPress updated at all times. The WordPress core team releases an update once a security vulnerability is reported. It is likely that you are using a vulnerable version of WordPress if you aren't updating your website.🔒 Pay Attention To Themes & Plugins🔑 In addition to keeping your WordPress core files updated, there are other areas where WordPress can be vulnerable that are not protected by core updates - for example, themes and plugins. Be sure to only install plugins and themes from reputable developers.🔒 Run Frequent Backups🔑 Having a backup of your WordPress website and important files is one way to keep your website protected. You do not want to be left with no backup if something happens to your website.🔒 Conclusion🔑 Cyberattacks can take many forms, from malware injection to DDoS attacks. Due to the popularity of the WordPress CMS, WordPress websites are a frequent target for hackers. In order to protect their WordPress websites, WordPress website owners must know how to do so.#wordpress#security#malware#sslcertificate",left_only

Suvam Sahoo,Your Go to WordPress Guy | Founder and CEO of Secure My WP,"If you’re building a site, if you’re a developer, or even if you’re a writer who writes articles about WordPress, you may find that you need to get a fresh install of WordPress every now and then to test different things from scratch.This can be time-consuming, especially if you need to do multiple fresh installs regularly.But you don't have to perform a full install every time you need a fresh install of WordPress!There’s a plugin called WP Reset that will let you reset WordPress as if it’s a fresh installation.To use this plugin, install it, then, go to Tools > WP Reset.Once you’re on the page, go to the Reset tab and scroll down to the very bottom. You will see a box where you need to type the word “reset” to use the Reset Site button to reset your site.This will now reset your installation as if it’s a brand new installation of WP.This is different from WordPress’s built-in reinstall function, which reinstalls WordPress but keeps your site’s data intact.On the contrary, WP Reset resets your WordPress installation as if it’s a truly fresh install. Your username and password remain the same, but everything else is removed.Keep in mind that your wp-uploads folder retains the files in it (but they won’t show up in your site’s media library anymore). To fix that, use WP Reset’s Clean uploads Folder tool in the Tools tab.If you found this post helpful, please comment ""WP reset"".#wordpress",left_only

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Why WordPress Website Needed the Care Plan❓📍 A WordPress care plan is a package designed specifically for a WordPress website. You might know these care plans by the name WordPress maintenance plans, support plans, or wp maintenance plans. They're all the same!✍ Enhanced Website Security📍 When it comes to websites, security is the one factor you should never compromise on. You can lose everything once there's a website security breach. In a WordPress web care plan, you get reputed security plugins for free.✍ Maximum Performance Benefits📍 WordPress developers continuously strive to make things faster. With every WordPress update, several performance and speed improvements are released along with new features added to the software. Needless to say, speed and user experience are two huge factors to retain traffic to your website.✍ Keep Your Website Fresh📍 You can regularly update your website content according to the evolving visitor demands and trends in your niche. Moreover, the freshness factor plays a crucial role in driving organic traffic to your website. Both the search engines and users favor a freshly updated website.✍ Time-Saving Investment📍 It takes too much time and energy to build a website from scratch, let alone maintain it monthly. You should work towards growing your business rather than tinkering with technicalities. Leave that to the professionals and focus on doing what you're good at.✍ Prevention Is Cheaper Than Cure📍 Website maintenance is an integral part of the entire web development life cycle. Overlooking this aspect could cost you big bucks, or even worse, critical data loss. Even restoring an old backup could mean irrecoverable loss of recent content updates, sales orders, and contact information database – something which could have been avoided altogether with regular website maintenance.✍ Looking For WordPress Care Plan?📍 WordPress care plans ensure that your website is secure and ready to attract prospects every second of every day. So to get the most out of your website and grow your business online, contact us today.#wordpresswebsite#woocommerce#wordpress#business#webdevelopment#security#maintenance#searchengines#performanceV2 Web Solutions",left_only
