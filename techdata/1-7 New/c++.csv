Erica Ballard,"I help working moms stay sane through coaching, community, and content. I also help companies retain moms.","Most postdocs complete their fellowships before getting pregnant, butChristina Coughlinknew it was time to become a mother.“I always go back and think ‘it was crazy to have a baby during fellowship. What was I thinking?’” she recalled. “But, you know, my husband and I were just ready. We were ready to be parents …and [my husband] said, ‘Look – I'll take care of her …your job shouldn't prevent us from being parents.’”So, with less than two years left in her oncology fellowship, Christina got pregnant. When she told Dr. Carl June, the head of her lab, he was excited for her. As a father of five, though, he knew that having children posed unique challenges in their field – especially for women.“One of the things that he [Dr. June] said to me as a mentor was, ‘you know, I'm thrilled for you, becoming a mother, but it's really hard in science and medicine. It's really hard to be a working mom,’” she recalled.👇 Click below for the full story👇#moms#workingwomen#dei",left_only
