The term ‘cloud-native’ really means that a specific approach was used while building the application.Specifically, cloud native applications are built around several small, self-contained services (referred to as ‘Microservices’) that are deployed on cloud infrastructure using containers. In summary, ‘cloud-native’ applications have the following characteristics:📌 Can be deployed to any type of cloud.📌 Take full advantage of cloud computing environments and scale up on demand, very fast.📌 Generally are composed of several ‘Microservices’, each providing a single business feature and communicating with each other via a well-defined set of APIs. These services, when combined, provide the application, its functionality.📌 Have an underlying infrastructure that supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which helps developers constantly add new features/functionality.📌 Make use of containers (such as Docker) to host the above services. Each container maintains resource isolation. It is these containers that provide a fast and easy way to provide additional services on demand.📌 Some way of managing the containers that host these services, the most popular being Kubernetes.FollowCloudnloud Tech Community#cloudnloud#AWS#linux#azure#ansible#docker#kubernetes#automation#jobs#fresher#jobseekers#tech#community#technology#career#cka#ckad#exam#software#microservices",left_only

The other gentleman is a MongoDB Guru he shared with me the flexibility of MongoDB across consumption models, by the way the meeting with both was to talk about how Dell Data Protection can help them achieve where native tools fail. That being said, I have condensed the conversation in below writeup, its amazing how much more you can learn with passionate people, rather than reading documentation at days.PS - if you are a DB admin, please show some love and mention in comments which DB you use and for what use case and above all how do you protect it.#database#aws#mongodb#mongodbatlas#dynamodb#dataprotection",left_only
