Elliot Rosenberg,"Founder, BossJi 🇮🇳 Turbocharge your hiring","Companies don't even bother to open your job application.When I was hiring, I admit I also ignored 90%+ of applications.These candidates all failed to do ONE critical thing.It’s sad because I’m sure many of them would’ve been great hires.In reality, it won’t matter how good your CV or qualifications are.Why?If no one NOTICES you, then you’ll never get a chance, let alone an offer!HR often gets hundreds of applications for each job. So, 5 to 10 words only separate the rejects from the shortlisted candidates.These important words are in your email subject line or LinkedIn InMail headline to the decision-maker.You should pay very close attention to each letter, space, and comma because they alone can ensure your application moves forward.Expect auto-rejects if you write:❌ no subject line❌ “Pooja Singh CV”❌ “job application”❌ “SEEKING JOB”The reason is that you’ve given the HR/hiring manager no motivation to open your application. Your subject line doesn’t stand out at all or answer the key questions the HR/hiring manager needs to know.The main objective of your subject line should be to get the HR/hiring manager to simply open your message! Only once they open your message can they see your cover letter and CV to consider shortlisting you.Your subject line will motivate the HR/hiring manager to open your application if it answers these questions:1. “To which role are you applying?” Companies often have many open positions, so be specific to ensure the right person sees your application.2. “Why are you qualified?” Show you have what it takes to succeed in the job.3. “Why should I trust you?” Reference a mutual connection or well-known current/ex-employer or institute to build trust.You may not be able to answer both #2 and #3, but try to at least answer either.Remember: your subject line needs to be extremely concise to fit on the screen and not get cut off, especially on mobile. To shorten it, you can use abbreviations the HR/hiring manager will understand (i.e., BDA for “Business Development Associate” or BFSI for “Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance”).I like to add a “?” at the end of the subject line because I feel it makes it harder to ignore. Most humans don’t like to leave questions unanswered.Thus, a formula for a strong subject line is:“[(A) Mutual connection or (B) Well-known employer/institute name + title or (C) Achievement] for [job title]?”Now, let’s look at some click-worthy subject lines:✅ “[Raj Patra’s Ref] 3 Yrs BFSI Exp for BDA?”✅ “Ex-TCS Team Lead for Ops Mgr?”✅ “₹10 Cr/Yr Sales Leader for AVP, Sales?”✅ “Gujarat U Topper for Backend Engineer?”Use this approach, and you’ll have an edge over most candidates.What’s the best job application subject line you’ve written? Let me know in the comments.#careertipsP.S. You can save this post for reference by clicking the “…” in the top right and then “Save.”",left_only

Pranay Pandey,Vice President Operations at Brainium Information Technologies Pvt. Ltd.,"As knowledge is the key to success, but you have to take advantage of opportunities, here is my story of how I got my first job, so the year was 2010, I had just completed my MCA, and the USA was experiencing a subprime mortgage crisis, India was in a recession, and there were hardly any ON-Campus and Off-Campus placement drives in India.When I completed my MCA in 2010, the companies were not ready to hire freshers yet.""C"" was my favorite programming language and to get the job I had done a PHP certification, gone on 7 interviews, and passed all of them, however, the requirements the company is giving are not acceptable to me like we will not pay you salary since you are a fresher, it is time for you to learn or after one month we will decide if you will get a salary or not.Being a fresher, I wasn't looking for a huge salary, only costs for my PG and transportation so that I could survive in Kolkata without asking my parents for money.But no company gave me an assurance that I'll be paid even after a month of working there, so I returned to my hometown of Durgapur, frustrated but not defeated.I began looking for a job in my hometown with the idea that, even if I was paid only Rs 500, I would work, since I don't have to pay for PGs, and 500 will cover my monthly transposition costs. My only focus was gaining knowledge.One opportunity came up and I got contacted by LexProSoft. I went for an interview, but the person who was supposed to interview me (also the owner of the company, he is now a very good friend of mine :D) was not available, so I had to wait for 3 hours and then go back home after it was informed that he will not available today.Again I got a new date for the interview and waited for 2 + hours, but he did not show, again I got a new date for the interview. This was my third time, and again I waited for 2 + hours, but I later saw him running towards the tech room, and he told one of his developers that he needed motherboard bios information.After 15 minutes, neither he nor the other developer was able to locate the details they are looking for, so one developer said we needed to open the system to find them. As I sat outside the room for 2+ hours listing all the conversations, I got the chance and I said I know how to get the details without opening the PC.Seeing me for the first time, he has no idea who I am or why I am sitting there, he asked reception, and they said that I came for an interview, so he asked me to come down to the tech room.I run the ""DXDIAG"" command on the windows system and it shows all the hardware details, with the help of single command I got my 1st job :)#ideateimplementsucceed#developer#work#job#opportunity",left_only

Meghamala C,"Executive Manager, Strategy & Operations Unit, Karnataka Skill Development Corporation, Govt of Karnataka","It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of the Industry Linkage Cell(ILC) of Karnataka Skill Development Corporation. We at ILC reach out to Industries, understand their skill demand, and facilitate them to become our training partners by streamlining the process. Going one step further, we have also actively encouraged Industries to adopt Hire-Train-Deploy, where Industries hire the candidates in the beginning and then train them according to their needs and deploy them in their Industries. Under Hire-Train-Deploy, KSDC funds the training process according to Common Cost Norms(CCN).In this regard and to have a greater outreach, we conducted 'Agriculture Conclave' and 'Logistics Conclave.' More than 300 Industries participated in the event and shared valuable insights on the sector's skill needs. The Minister for skill development and entrepreneurship, Dr. Ashwath Narayana C N, Principal Secretary to Government, Dr. S Selvakumar, and Managing Director of KSDC, Mr. Ashwin D Gowda, graced the event and responded to Industrial needs and queries. It was a cherry on the top moment when more than 10 MoUs were signed in the event, and 30 plus industries showed a willingness to be a part of the state's skill development program, Chief Minister's Koushalya Karnataka Yojana(CMKKY). The success of these conclaves is nudging us to conduct more such events in the near future for other sectors as well.#skilldevelopment#industryconnect#publicpolicy#KSDC",left_only
