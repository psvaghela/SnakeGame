Liz Keable,Metacognition in Practice - I support schools/parents to develop metacognition in children and young people for the benefit of improving mental health and academic progress.,"Establishing why metacognition matters so much has been a recurring theme over the last few issues of this newsletter. Never fear, we will get into the 'how' to develop the skill in future issues, but I am hoping that readers who are part of school leadership teams can now see the value of a whole school approach.For others, who have subscribed because you have an interest in the development, education and/or future chances of children and young people, or because metacognition as a subject that holds some fascination for you, I hope that these early issues have been helpful.I mention a new workshop at the end of this particular edition, so if anyone is interested, please feel free to connect, or direct message me in the meantime, so that I can make sure more detailed information comes your way when I release them next month.#education#schoolleadership#metacognition#lizkeable#mentalhealth",left_only

"Kevin Ervin Kelley, AIA",Architect. Innovation Coach. Int'l Speaker. Dad.,"I've been lucky enough to meet most of my business heroes and fortunate to work with some extraordinary leaders. But seeing them at a conference, lecture, or public setting versus meeting them in their office is vastly different.While these leaders seem so put together and polished in public, once I see them inside their offices, they often look like a pack of wild animals are chasing them around the corridors. (BTW: I'm no different in my office!)In this latest edition of The Attention Architect, I will discuss what happens to leaders in their offices and three strategies for how you can help them manage the chaos of business.If you find this helpful article, please forward it to your colleagues.
