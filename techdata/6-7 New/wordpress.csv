Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a¬†flowchart¬†rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability. These platforms also generally have features that allow for experimenting, prototyping, testing and deployment.List Of Most Commonly Used LCNC Platforms :***Open Source Platforms***-Budibase-Huginn-WordPress-¬†Node-RED Brasil-PyCaret***Paid Platforms***-Appian Corporation- Google AppSheet-Mendix- Microsoft PowerApps-¬†Salesforce Lightning-Sisense-¬†Zoho Creator#lcnc#lowcode#nocode#lowcodenocode#lowcodeplatform#lowcodedevelopment#nocodeapps",left_only

Sarang Pokhare (He/Him),Senior Digital Marketing Manager at Diamante Blockchain | IIM Calcutta | ICO & Crowdfunding | Email Marketing | Inbound & Demand Generation,"A content management system (CMS) is a platform that lets you easily create a website without relying heavily on custom-coded solutions. These easy-to-use website creation tools have exploded in popularity over the last 10+ years; in 2011 just 24% of websites utilized a CMS ‚Äì now that number is nearly 64%. Given their popularity, it‚Äôs no surprise that many folks grow to have an attachment to a particular type of CMS, especially agencies like us who end up creating hundreds of sites for our various clients.At a(m), we prefer to do our development in WordPress. It truly is the dominant player in the CMS game, as nearly 65% of all websites today are built on WordPress. Not only that, but WordPress accounts for a whopping 96% of all blog-based content management systems and powers 34.7% of the top 1 million websites on the web.So, why use WordPress as opposed to another content management system? As an agency, we have been developing in WordPress for a little over a decade. But, when you combine the experience of our entire development team, they have a staggering 40+ years worth of expertise in the CMS. These numbers alone make it our go-to platform, but it becomes even more evident as the leading choice when you see some of the great functionality it offers.Open SourceWe use the WordPress content management system because it allows us to self-host websites for our clients. Ultimately, a self-hosted system provides more functionality and flexibility than relying solely on someone else‚Äôs technology. We estimate that 50% of our clients, no matter how simple the website, have something unique about their business that they want to be represented on their website in a way that requires a custom coding solution. We need the flexibility of an open-source system to achieve this, which is why we consistently turn to WordPress.Personalized ThemeHere at a(m), we have created and maintained a proprietary, Underscores-based theme. From there, it‚Äôs modified and molded to fit our client‚Äôs needs. Starting from a base theme allows us to speed up the development process because we‚Äôre not starting from scratch. And, given that we‚Äôve been using our theme for years, we‚Äôre well-versed in what it contains and can easily add or remove certain elements to meet the needs of each client.Enhanced MarketabilityWe think about so much more than putting up your website and walking away. From search engine and conversion rate optimization efforts to ongoing marketing initiatives, these efforts require us to monitor the website and then make adjustments. This is significantly easier to achieve when we have free reign to install tracking codes, create custom backend workflows, and can quickly and easily create new landing pages. We‚Äôve found that even the most popular proprietary content management systems have limitations that prevent us from performing this marketing work exactly as we‚Äôd like to.So, we‚Äôve established why we think WordPress is wonde...",left_only

Hastimal Shah,üí° #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. üëâV2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Wanna Secure your WordPress Website‚ùì Check Below Steps to Secure ‚ùóüîí Implement SSL Certificatesüîë Millions of websites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates to protect their online transactions. A SSL certificate should be one of the first steps you take to secure your website. SSL certificates are available for purchase, but most hosting providers provide them for free.üîí Require & Use Strong Passwordsüîë As well as obtaining an SSL certificate, one of the first things you should do to protect your site is to use strong passwords for all your logins. If you use a familiar or easy-to-remember password, you put yourself, your users, and your website at risk. By strengthening your password, you reduce your chances of being hacked.üîí Enable Two-Factor Authentication for WP-Adminüîë For your WordPress website, enable two-factor authentication (2FA). With this authentication method, you need to enter a unique code in order to complete the login process, adding a second layer of security to WordPress' login page.üîí Limit Login Attemptsüîë You are allowed to make as many login attempts as you want with WordPress. The WordPress admin area is vulnerable to brute force attacks by hackers using different password combinations until they find the right one.üîí Install A Security Pluginüîë There are several great security plugins available for WordPress, and plugins are a great way to add features to your website.Adding a security plugin to your website can add extra layers of protection without much effort.üîí Keep WordPress Core Files Updatedüîë To maintain the security and stability of your site, you should keep your WordPress updated at all times. The WordPress core team releases an update once a security vulnerability is reported. It is likely that you are using a vulnerable version of WordPress if you aren't updating your website.üîí Pay Attention To Themes & Pluginsüîë In addition to keeping your WordPress core files updated, there are other areas where WordPress can be vulnerable that are not protected by core updates - for example, themes and plugins. Be sure to only install plugins and themes from reputable developers.üîí Run Frequent Backupsüîë Having a backup of your WordPress website and important files is one way to keep your website protected. You do not want to be left with no backup if something happens to your website.üîí Conclusionüîë Cyberattacks can take many forms, from malware injection to DDoS attacks. Due to the popularity of the WordPress CMS, WordPress websites are a frequent target for hackers. In order to protect their WordPress websites, WordPress website owners must know how to do so.#wordpress#security#malware#sslcertificate",left_only

Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a¬†flowchart¬†rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability.
