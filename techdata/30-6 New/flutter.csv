This time I will make an exception to that rule as I would like to share with you a story.A story that's of the utmost importance for me. It simply means a lot.So let me make a twist and start from the end.During the past few months, I have:🔸  Obtained the PMP® certification;🔸  Passed the AgilePM Foundation and the AgilePM Practitioner exams;🔸  Passed the Change Management Foundation and the Change Management Practitioner exams;🔸  Taken courses from the Interaction Design Foundation: Become a UX Designer from Scratch; User Experience: The Beginner’s Guide and Journey Mapping🔸  Wrote a 500 pages’ journal on personal experience and growth;🔸  Travelled, mostly solo, to 10+ countries;🔸  Learned Spanish on a conversational level.But before all that was accomplished there was a lot of dark days, pain and anxiety.A picture that was more black and grey than rosy. A picture, on which the smile was nothing more than a mask I had to put on every single day.If you would like to know what happened before the picture below was taken, I sincerely invite you to read my article.On the other hand, if the happy expression captured on the photo below annoys you already, then simply keep scrolling.
