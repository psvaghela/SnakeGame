Preeti Gupta,SEO is what drives me everyday.,"What is AMP?Known as Accelerated Mobile Pages, it shows the stripped-down version of a page in the SERPs.When it was launched in 2016, everyone thought this was ""the next big thing"" because of how much it helps, but slowly the trend was out and nobody was talking about the same.❓ So how does AMP help websites?Mainly it had to do with speed. AMP cuts all the ""unnecessary"" elements from the page like ads, javascript, images, and more and only shows the main content. Because Google and users love the speed and fast loading of pages, marketers used them,❓ What are the disadvantages of using AMP pages?It can become difficult to implement if you don't use WordPress. You may need to get help from a developer.As the ads don't show up on the AMP pages, the revenue drops and you make less money.The content goes to the google cache server and the URL will redirect to the AMP version as well as you lose all the creative controls for the page.Many marketers say that they can't capture leads as all the downloadable assets and javascript elements get deleted.There are more cons than pros and that's why it's not the best strategy to implement.❓ Who should use AMP pages?You struggle with speed and after doing many things, you cant get your pages to speed up.If the majority of your traffic comes from mobile searches.If you want to capture leads, get revenue from Google ads, or have already a fast website then you may not need the AMP.This was a long one.Did you like it? then don't forget to like and comment.#amp#seo",left_only

Here is the detail about it.1) Easier Editing with the Block Editor – This phase was just the first part of a four-phase plan to modernize WordPress. This Phase was the new block editor, which was released in WordPress version 5.0 and available for posts and pages.2) Full Site Editing Customization Options - This Phase is even easier for WordPress users to customize their websites without coding and also available as a plugin for earlier version of WordPress.3) Multi-Author Collaboration - This phase of the Gutenberg project is scheduled to start in 2022. After this phase, Gutenberg will allow multiple people to edit WordPress website content simultaneously, much like in Google Docs.4) Multilingual Website Support - Core implementation for Multi-lingual sites. The final phase of WordPress’s Gutenberg project will make multilingual support a core component of WordPress. After this release, developers will no need to use translation plugins like WPML. This phase will take us well beyond 2022.#wordpress,#wordpressplugin,#wordpresswebsite,#wordpressblog,#wordpressdevelopment,#wordpressblogger",left_only

Chandan Kala,Assisting Medical Practitioners in increasing their online presence,"By now you guys might have understood how important it is to have a good online presence so I won't discuss that. Today I am going to discuss whether to have your own team or to outsource it to a company.I agree that having your own team (employees) to manage your digital presence sounds more promising compared to outsoursing it to a company.Just like every decision has its own pros and cons, you should weigh the benefits and challenges before taking a decision.The benefit of having your own marketing team is that you will have people who will work only for you and be available every day to get things done for you. They will have better domain expertise because they will be constantly working with you. The cost will be less when you get the same amount of work done by a third party.Now let's discuss the challenges of having your own team. Having your own marketing team is a very costly, time and energy consuming affair. For eg, for your digital marketing team you will need a medical content writer, general content writer, designer, video editor, developer (someone expert in html/css/js or wordpress), someone to do on page seo, off page seo, local seo, paid marketing expert (google ads or facebook ads), manager to manage all of them, etc. and these all fields are interlinked, even if one of the person is on leave other work might get hamper so you need to have a back up as well. Now think the amount of salary, time and energy that will go in keeping that team. And let me tell you good employees don't come cheap.Now you might say we can have an all-rounder, who knows everything. First of all, it's very difficult to find that person. Suppose you find one, what will you do if he/she switches the job or is not able to continue because of some medical reason. Nowadays, every company is facing the challenge of employee retention, be it fortune 500 or a local vendor so think of that point as well.So now the choice is up to you. Think before you act.#digitalmarketing#healthcaremarketing#marketing",left_only

Prathamesh Sakhadeo,WordPress Expert,"WordPress is not secure, and I don't want to build my website using WordPress.How many times you've heard this from a client?It's true that WordPress is a very popular technology to build websites, and is prone to attack from hackers.But, many times it's the developer's mistake that the website is vulnerable.It's a known fact that the username of WordPress should not be admin.But we are too lazy to give a different username.Let's not even talk about the password. They are so easy to guess that the hacker must be feeling unchallenged.Another point is using nulled plugins and themes. Your website is face of your business and it needs investment.That means sometimes you need to purchase premium themes and plugins.But to save the cost, many people opt for illegally obtained nulled plugins and themes.Many times these are infested with malware and malicious scripts.Another reason for poor security is outdated themes and plugins. WordPress like any other software needs maintenance and that means you need to update themes and plugins regularly.Installing plugins like WordFence and changing the login URL of WordPress also helps a lot.So, yes, WordPress is prone to attacks but you can make it secure.#wordpress#wordpresssecurity",left_only
