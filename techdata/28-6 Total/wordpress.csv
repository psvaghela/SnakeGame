Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"8 classy WordPress Hacks that every developer needs to know🧵⬇1️⃣ Pick a theme carefully because switching later is a hassle👉 With WordPress, you have a wide range of choices when it comes to themes. WordPress themes such as Elementor and Divi are truly impressive. Most importantly, they feature an easy-to-use website editor.2️⃣ Make your website's typography stand out by adding custom fonts👉 Calibri and Arial can get a bit boring after a while. The first step to improving the typography of a website is for the developer to make it as eye-catching as possible.3️⃣ Limit down the plugins on your website so they don't slow it down👉 It's not just about loading speed, but plugins continue to consume server resources in the background. A number of them increase database queries that sucks bandwidth.4️⃣ Save your and client's time too by choosing right page builders👉 Because of their many features, drag-and-drop interfaces, and flexible layouts, some, but not all, page builder plugins are inefficiently coded. There's a real danger of performance issues and a slow website is bad news for SEO.So figure out the best page builders for your website, Elementor and DIVI are performing good in this.5️⃣ Optimize your page loading time by compressing images👉 The size of images is one of the most important factors affecting page load speeds. Using WordPress for e-commerce poses a big problem because these sites rely heavily on images. Thats the reason compressing the image is a good habit for a WordPress developer.6️⃣ Protect the frontend to prevent hacks👉 Choose a top-of-the-line security plugin, such as Sucuri or Jetpack. Although hosting companies claim their security systems are invincible, it doesn't hurt to be cautious.Replacehttps://lnkd.in/dUt8ffdcfrommysite.com/wp-login.phpor /wp-admin/7️⃣ Use permalinks that support SEO👉 There is an URL for every page of the site, such ashttps://lnkd.in/d2W8PFMg. Your browser uses this to find the page. As a default, WordPress uses a query string such asmywebsite.com/?p=898️⃣ To reduce scroll lengths, use comment pagination settings👉 Go to Settings > Discussion and scroll to Other Comment Settings. Now tick Break Comments Into Pages.🤞 Final thoughts!There are so many customization options with WordPress that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, we choose hacks that are easy to use and widely applicable.Cheers!#wordpress#seo#developer#frontend#typography#commerce#elementor#divibuilder#wordpresswebsite"

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"Why WordPress Website Needed the Care Plan❓📍 A WordPress care plan is a package designed specifically for a WordPress website. You might know these care plans by the name WordPress maintenance plans, support plans, or wp maintenance plans. They're all the same!✍ Enhanced Website Security📍 When it comes to websites, security is the one factor you should never compromise on. You can lose everything once there's a website security breach. In a WordPress web care plan, you get reputed security plugins for free.✍ Maximum Performance Benefits📍 WordPress developers continuously strive to make things faster. With every WordPress update, several performance and speed improvements are released along with new features added to the software. Needless to say, speed and user experience are two huge factors to retain traffic to your website.✍ Keep Your Website Fresh📍 You can regularly update your website content according to the evolving visitor demands and trends in your niche. Moreover, the freshness factor plays a crucial role in driving organic traffic to your website. Both the search engines and users favor a freshly updated website.✍ Time-Saving Investment📍 It takes too much time and energy to build a website from scratch, let alone maintain it monthly. You should work towards growing your business rather than tinkering with technicalities. Leave that to the professionals and focus on doing what you're good at.✍ Prevention Is Cheaper Than Cure📍 Website maintenance is an integral part of the entire web development life cycle. Overlooking this aspect could cost you big bucks, or even worse, critical data loss. Even restoring an old backup could mean irrecoverable loss of recent content updates, sales orders, and contact information database – something which could have been avoided altogether with regular website maintenance.✍ Looking For WordPress Care Plan?📍 WordPress care plans ensure that your website is secure and ready to attract prospects every second of every day. So to get the most out of your website and grow your business online, contact us today.#wordpresswebsite#woocommerce#wordpress#business#webdevelopment#security#maintenance#searchengines#performanceV2 Web Solutions"

Users visually select and connect reusable components that represent particular steps or capabilities (which contain the actual code), and link them together to create the desired computerized workflow.Users can create applications as if they were drafting a flowchart rather than writing line-by-line codes for each desired function and capability. These platforms also generally have features that allow for experimenting, prototyping, testing and deployment.List Of Most Commonly Used LCNC Platforms :***Open Source Platforms***-Budibase-Huginn-WordPress-Node-RED Brasil-PyCaret***Paid Platforms***-Appian Corporation- Google AppSheet-Mendix- Microsoft PowerApps-Salesforce Lightning-Sisense-Zoho Creator#lcnc#lowcode#nocode#lowcodenocode#lowcodeplatform#lowcodedevelopment#nocodeapps#budibase#microsoftpowerapps#huginn#revolutionary#future#wordpress#nodered#pycaret#appian#appiandeveloper#googleapps#mendix#salesforcelightning#zohocreator#development#opensource#coding#work#testing#environment#salesforce#softwaredevelopment"

Suvam Sahoo,Your Go to WordPress Guy | Founder and CEO of Secure My WP,"If you’re building a site, if you’re a developer, or even if you’re a writer who writes articles about WordPress, you may find that you need to get a fresh install of WordPress every now and then to test different things from scratch.This can be time-consuming, especially if you need to do multiple fresh installs regularly.But you don't have to perform a full install every time you need a fresh install of WordPress!There’s a plugin called WP Reset that will let you reset WordPress as if it’s a fresh installation.To use this plugin, install it, then, go to Tools > WP Reset.Once you’re on the page, go to the Reset tab and scroll down to the very bottom. You will see a box where you need to type the word “reset” to use the Reset Site button to reset your site.This will now reset your installation as if it’s a brand new installation of WP.This is different from WordPress’s built-in reinstall function, which reinstalls WordPress but keeps your site’s data intact.On the contrary, WP Reset resets your WordPress installation as if it’s a truly fresh install. Your username and password remain the same, but everything else is removed.Keep in mind that your wp-uploads folder retains the files in it (but they won’t show up in your site’s media library anymore). To fix that, use WP Reset’s Clean uploads Folder tool in the Tools tab.If you found this post helpful, please comment ""WP reset"".#wordpress"

Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"🚫 Don't Make These Mistakes If You Are a WordPress Developer 🚫📌 Failing to optimize media✔ Large, high-resolution images can be printed or cropped to be viewed at full scale without losing image quality. However, if uploaded directly to your WordPress media library, they will usually be stored as large and unoptimized images.📌 Ignoring the XML sitemap✔ Sitemaps are essential on larger websites because they enable search engines to crawl all of your pages. Unfortunately, this crucial feature is not yet native to WordPress, so you must use a plugin.📌 Missing Updates✔ In addition to patching performance, design, and usability issues, these updates also patch vulnerabilities that can allow hackers to access your website.📌 Installing poorly coded themes✔ The reason is that invalid HTML can cause rendering issues, which affect both users and search engines. In addition, many themes load a ridiculous amount of scripts, images, fonts, and other types of files, making it difficult for your pages to load quickly.📌 Excessive plugin installation✔ Adding functionality to WordPress is as simple as installing one or more plugins. But, such plugins often load a lot of scripts, CSS files, images, and fonts, further degrading speed and creating a poor user experience.📌 Neglecting security✔ Despite all your efforts, your website can never be completely secure. Hardening your security, on the other hand, will deter the vast majority of hackers, except those explicitly targeting you.📌 Failing to perform backups regularly.✔ You need to perform backups regularly. It is essential to have a website running smoothly. In addition to enabling you to roll back changes, it may also help you to quickly recover from a hack by restoring an older version of your site.📌 Eliminating the schema element.✔ Search engines use schema to determine what your content is about, and how the entities within the content relate to each other. Schema may not directly affect ranking, but additional visual cues can lead to an increased clickthrough rate.💡 Conclusion 💡It's hard to stop WordPress Development mistakes. Still, with a bit of forethought and hopefully a few of the following tips, you should be able to avoid costly blunders. Pay attention to the details, and you'll be fine!#wordpress#developer#design#html#css#wordpressdesign#wordpresstips#quality"

Sarang Pokhare (IIM Calcutta Alumni),"Senior Digital Marketing Manager @ Diamante Blockchain | IIM Calcutta | Inbound, PPC & Email Marketing | ICO & Crowdfunding Marketing","Reflections about low-code data managementhttps://ift.tt/i6g3YaJYou wouldn’t code a website from scratch, so why would you code your corporate data estate from scratch? As it turns out, data engineers and business intelligence professionals can learn a great deal from the history of website development to help us with managing our corporate data estate.In the early days of the Internet, websites were developed from scratch using coding languages like HTML and CSS. This was a complex process that often required a team of web designers and developers, a complex stack of tools, and months of development time.There were actually a number of advantages to building a website this way:Design Precision: It allowed for complete control over the design of the website.Customization: It meant that the website could be customized to a very specific set of requirements.Hosting & Storage: It gave the website owner complete control over the hosting, storage, and migration of the website.But on the flipside, there were several drawbacks of developing a website from scratch:Expensive: It was very time-consuming and expensive.Highly-technical: It required a lot of technical knowledge and skills (which are hard to staff for, especially with the talent shortages organizations continue to struggle with).Error-prone: It is prone to errors and coding mistakes that can be very difficult to track down and fix.The Shift to Low-code Website DevelopmentAs more people began using the Internet, better tools and resources became available. Today, the market is full of low-code Content Management Systems (CMS) and drag-and-drop website builders (WordPress, HubSpot, Shopify, Squarespace, etc.) that make it easy to create a professional-looking website without any coding knowledge.While there are still a handful of very specific use cases where you would need to code a website from scratch, organizations realized that using a low-code CMS or drag-and-drop builder was a much better option in the vast majority of cases.This shift has led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of time and effort required to build a website. In fact, you can now create an entire website in just a few hours using these low-code tools.With every great shift comes some level of resistance. At first, web developers were skeptical of (or outright opposed to) low-code tools for the following reasons:Fear of Replacement: Developers saw these tools as a threat to their jobs.Power & Flexibility: Developers were unconvinced that they would be powerful, flexible, or customizable enough to produce the same quality of work.Trust & Reliability: Since the code was generated automatically, developers were unsure that it could be trusted to the same degree as the code they wrote themselves.But over time, most developers came to realize that these fears were unfounded and that these tools were not a replacement for their skills but rather a complement.The benefits beca..."

Prathamesh Sakhadeo,WordPress Expert,"WordPress is not secure, and I don't want to build my website using WordPress.How many times you've heard this from a client?It's true that WordPress is a very popular technology to build websites, and is prone to attack from hackers.But, many times it's the developer's mistake that the website is vulnerable.It's a known fact that the username of WordPress should not be admin.But we are too lazy to give a different username.Let's not even talk about the password. They are so easy to guess that the hacker must be feeling unchallenged.Another point is using nulled plugins and themes. Your website is face of your business and it needs investment.That means sometimes you need to purchase premium themes and plugins.But to save the cost, many people opt for illegally obtained nulled plugins and themes.Many times these are infested with malware and malicious scripts.Another reason for poor security is outdated themes and plugins. WordPress like any other software needs maintenance and that means you need to update themes and plugins regularly.Installing plugins like WordFence and changing the login URL of WordPress also helps a lot.So, yes, WordPress is prone to attacks but you can make it secure.#wordpress#wordpresssecurity"

Nihal Ahmed,SDE-1 at Masai School,"I used to create websites with WordPress themes. But that wasn't enough so I joinedMasai SchoolAfter school and pre-university college, I took up engineering in computer science, a step towards my goal of becoming a 'pro' at computers and eventually a cybersecurity expert.After graduating, I realized I didn't have the skills required to work at a cybersecurity firm and realized that I should first know how to develop software on the Internet before I protect people from breaking down/securing them from bad actors.I joined a small startup as a web developer to begin my developer journey and the work there mostly involved building sites using ready made WordPress themes. I was curious to know how to actually build websites from start to end without using these readily available themes. I started researching a bit and learnt that I need to skill up and understand tech stacks like LAMP & MERN.I was trying to learn it all from the Internet and didn't know where to even start. Fortunately, one evening when I was browsing, I came across an article onYourStory Mediawhich talked about a military-style coding school in Bangalore. I was very undisciplined and so military style education is just what I needed. My discipline took a 180-degree turn after I enrolled at Masai school. The person who used to wake up late and rush to his job at 9:30 am, was here, waking up early in the morning and rushing to the campus, to complete the pending rigorous assignments.One difference I noticed between when I was trying to learn things on my own and after enrolling into Masai was that I didn't have the discipline, the right direction, quality and quantity that I should focus on when I was learning on my own. The Internet has a vast amount of information but without discipline and right direction, I believe it is difficult to reach your destination on time. The funny thing is I thought I knew HTML until I learnt it at Masai. I enjoyed learning at Masai and the collaboration with my peers. Also the amazing team at Masai who was always available to guide me in the right direction but never spoon-feed us!I am happy to say that I was selected as an IA at Masai even before completing the last unit of the course, and am now promoted to SDE-1. The salary is 10x times my previous salary!#masaischool#coding#softwaredeveloper#webdeveloper#wordpress#sde1"

Farhatabassum Khan,Founder | I help businesses to build remarkable branding & websites.,"Debunking Common WordPress Website Myths🔮 Myth #5: Every small external task needs a plugin💯 Facts: WordPress is an open-source platform, you can learn it, use the code, improve the code, and can customize it according to your needs.💡 If you know how to use and customize WordPress code, there are endless possibilities to customize and add any functionality to your website.💡 Developers have developed a plugin for everything and contributed to making a big easy to use platform.💡 If you don't want to use a plugin then you don't have to. Plugins are great for someone who doesn't know how to code.Takeaway:If you don't want to use N number of plugins to develop a great website for your business, then hire freelancers or an agency just likeAxial Design Studio.

Nikhil Bhansali,"Youtuber, Video Marketer, Content Creator :)","No BS SEO guideSEO is trying to get yourself discovered by your customers searching about their problems and solutions. It can be on Google, Amazon, YouTube - whichever the search engine the basics are the same.2 words to summarise everything you need to know about SEO - Content and Distribution.Let's start with#distributionYou need a FAST website, so fast that You don't notice the time between clicking on link and opening the page. Choose a blogging platform which works well, after lot of testing I can suggest#superblog. If you're planning to use wordpress, make sure you have a developer resource full time to optimise your site constantly.Next you need to figure out what your clients are searching for. In the language they're searching for (crucial point many businesses ignore). You must have heard this a 100 times but priorities topic which is the intersection of- Good volume (100k+ searches for B2C, 1000+ searches for B2B monthly)- Low competition- Common senseThe difference between a good SEO expert and a great one is Common Sense first 2 bits are easy, third one is hard.After you complete the above research for distribution (which for a startup shouldn't take more than 8 hours) it's time to shift our focus to#contentI cannot emphasize this enough, do any black hat techniques, do whatever back linking, do any amount of SEO hacks none of it matters if your content is not excellent.Most companies spend 80-90% of their SEO#timeon things other than content. While it should be the other way around.There is no cure for bad content. You'll be surprised how many things you can get away with if you stop EVERYTHING ELSE and focus on just good content. Write compelling, thoughtful, well researched content and reap the benefits for YEARS. Your content should be so well written that you have to NEVER request for backlinks - they should come on their own.Do these 2 basics consistently and Keep Calm. Traffic will come.Don't splurge on expensive tools, consultants (when you're starting) and other guides. just follow the above steps.Any doubts let me know but this has worked for me time and again."

William Review,8 followers,"Affiliate Marketing = Hand Off Income. It’s no secret. Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest and most profitable ways to make money online. So why are you still struggling to earn affiliate commissions? Here Is Why Your Affiliate Sites Are Not Earning. Low Engagement = Poor Conversions. Most affiliates sites just post a boring review of a product with a couple of pictures and hope to make some sales.
