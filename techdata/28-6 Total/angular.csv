"Dr. Vivek Pandey, PhD, MFM, BE","Technopreneur, CEO I COO I SVP, SAP I Digital Leader","The market for drones is growing dramatically. Surveying and mapping of mineral landscapes is a time-consuming process. By employing drones and a drone pilot, instead of a piloted plane, a mine can save around 90% of the cost per hour, and collect unlimited aerial data - including fine measurements by simultaneously capturing high-end orthoimages. The most common use for drones at mines today is stockpile measurement. Estimating inventory quickly and safely makes a big difference– as dramatic as inspection duration going from 2 days down to 10 minutes. This ease of use also allows mines to inspect their stockpiles much more often. What used to be done once a quarter can now be done once a day, leading to much more accurate data and better decisions. In the 12 years leading to 2015, the fatality rate in the mining industry decreased by 64.5%, from 12.4 worker fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2003 to 4.4 in 2015. However, the mining industry still has among the highest fatality rates among all industries in the country. Digital solutions that help miners improve their safety record and facilitate better compliance are set to experience sustained demand. An Accenture study identified technological transformation as a significant growth strategy for mining companies – 92% of mining executives plan to increase investment in technology over the next three years, and more than a quarter expect those increases to be significant. According to a KPMG survey, the highest level of investment is occurring in data and analytics tools (53%), autonomous vehicles (30%), and robotic process automation (29%). Ball mills, SAG mills, crushers, stockpile fillers and flotation cells – these environments are so hazardous for workers that operations need to be shutdown in order for inspections to be performed, at a high cost to the mine. Eric Romersa, CEO of WS Data 3D, says that a one hour inspection could cost a mine $100,000 to $150,000 in lost production costs – a cost eliminated by using a drone. The overall Drone and UAV market is estimated to be USD 58.4 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 16.4% from 2021 to 2026.#transformation#technology#digital#data#experience#strategy#automation#analytics#compliance#growth#investment#safety#mining#ceo#miningindustry"

Kalpa Senanayake,Technical Lead at Vodafone,"Many software deliveries ended up with one or more forms of failure. Some projects or products could not be delivered on time. Others do not meet the client, consumer expectations. Some deliveries achieve expectations but fail to retain key people who contributed due to the burnout caused by the project.Over the past ten years, I have been involved in various software deliveries. Some are project-oriented others are product-oriented. I have been learning from these engagements, observing what worked well and what failed.These reasons are from my own first-hand experience of where things went wrong. These are neither the only reasons for failures nor the suggestions to address the underlying problems.I am keen to listen to examples you may have experienced and how you have solved those. Hence, this is an effort to share the knowledge and learn from each other.#softwareengineering#softwareprojectmanagement"

Yet, the outcome can have lasting impact on our earnings, career trajectory and overall wellbeing.It should go without saying that, whether you’re negotiating for your dream job or are juggling multiple attractive offers (some of which you will decline), it’s important to handle all offers professionally.The interactions that you have with a potential employer during the interview and offer negotiation phases of your job search create an impression (on both sides).Our worlds are small and it’s important to conduct yourself in a way that keeps the door open for future opportunities and connections.#opportunities#wellbeing#future"
