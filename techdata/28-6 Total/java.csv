Kumar Karpe,"CEO, Kapittx, AP/AR automation, B2B Payments, Ex-IBM","Kapittx was born during covid and working from home was customary for all of us.At heart we knew, we were missing office -Face-to-face interactions to ideateSharing jokes, songs, meals and the general camaraderie of being together!Simply asking someone a question out loud rather than messagingOffice Printer - ""no"" 😁, not for us. We avoid paper. Moreover, we automate and digitize CFO's back officeWe all at Kapittx are excited to move to our own office. Our approach was very clear - ""Employee Safety First""Instead of opting for a co-working set-up, we decided to lease our own officeIt gives us a safety net against CovidCreates an easy transition from work from home setupIt gives us the home comforts we are habituatedEvery Kapittxer enthusiasm was at a different level. Its time to move from ""work from home"" to ""back to the office""We are hiring Java developers and also strengthening our customer success, sales, and business development teams.Please write to us atcareers@kapittx.com#hiring#sales#businessdevelopment#customersuccess#java"
