Hastimal Shah,💡 #Wordpress & Shopify Expert & Consultant. 👉V2 Web Solutions Website Design & Development Agency,"8 classy WordPress Hacks that every developer needs to know🧵⬇1️⃣ Pick a theme carefully because switching later is a hassle👉 With WordPress, you have a wide range of choices when it comes to themes. WordPress themes such as Elementor and Divi are truly impressive. Most importantly, they feature an easy-to-use website editor.2️⃣ Make your website's typography stand out by adding custom fonts👉 Calibri and Arial can get a bit boring after a while. The first step to improving the typography of a website is for the developer to make it as eye-catching as possible.3️⃣ Limit down the plugins on your website so they don't slow it down👉 It's not just about loading speed, but plugins continue to consume server resources in the background. A number of them increase database queries that sucks bandwidth.4️⃣ Save your and client's time too by choosing right page builders👉 Because of their many features, drag-and-drop interfaces, and flexible layouts, some, but not all, page builder plugins are inefficiently coded. There's a real danger of performance issues and a slow website is bad news for SEO.So figure out the best page builders for your website, Elementor and DIVI are performing good in this.5️⃣ Optimize your page loading time by compressing images👉 The size of images is one of the most important factors affecting page load speeds. Using WordPress for e-commerce poses a big problem because these sites rely heavily on images. Thats the reason compressing the image is a good habit for a WordPress developer.6️⃣ Protect the frontend to prevent hacks👉 Choose a top-of-the-line security plugin, such as Sucuri or Jetpack. Although hosting companies claim their security systems are invincible, it doesn't hurt to be cautious.Replacehttps://lnkd.in/dUt8ffdcfrommysite.com/wp-login.phpor /wp-admin/7️⃣ Use permalinks that support SEO👉 There is an URL for every page of the site, such ashttps://lnkd.in/d2W8PFMg. Your browser uses this to find the page. As a default, WordPress uses a query string such asmywebsite.com/?p=898️⃣ To reduce scroll lengths, use comment pagination settings👉 Go to Settings > Discussion and scroll to Other Comment Settings. Now tick Break Comments Into Pages.🤞 Final thoughts!There are so many customization options with WordPress that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, we choose hacks that are easy to use and widely applicable.Cheers!#wordpress#seo#developer#frontend#typography#commerce#elementor#divibuilder#wordpresswebsite",left_only

Prathamesh Sakhadeo,WordPress Expert,"WordPress is not secure, and I don't want to build my website using WordPress.How many times you've heard this from a client?It's true that WordPress is a very popular technology to build websites, and is prone to attack from hackers.But, many times it's the developer's mistake that the website is vulnerable.It's a known fact that the username of WordPress should not be admin.But we are too lazy to give a different username.Let's not even talk about the password. They are so easy to guess that the hacker must be feeling unchallenged.Another point is using nulled plugins and themes. Your website is face of your business and it needs investment.That means sometimes you need to purchase premium themes and plugins.But to save the cost, many people opt for illegally obtained nulled plugins and themes.Many times these are infested with malware and malicious scripts.Another reason for poor security is outdated themes and plugins. WordPress like any other software needs maintenance and that means you need to update themes and plugins regularly.Installing plugins like WordFence and changing the login URL of WordPress also helps a lot.So, yes, WordPress is prone to attacks but you can make it secure.#wordpress#wordpresssecurity",left_only

Nikhil Bhansali,"Youtuber, Video Marketer, Content Creator :)","No BS SEO guideSEO is trying to get yourself discovered by your customers searching about their problems and solutions. It can be on Google, Amazon, YouTube - whichever the search engine the basics are the same.2 words to summarise everything you need to know about SEO - Content and Distribution.Let's start with#distributionYou need a FAST website, so fast that You don't notice the time between clicking on link and opening the page. Choose a blogging platform which works well, after lot of testing I can suggest#superblog. If you're planning to use wordpress, make sure you have a developer resource full time to optimise your site constantly.Next you need to figure out what your clients are searching for. In the language they're searching for (crucial point many businesses ignore). You must have heard this a 100 times but priorities topic which is the intersection of- Good volume (100k+ searches for B2C, 1000+ searches for B2B monthly)- Low competition- Common senseThe difference between a good SEO expert and a great one is Common Sense first 2 bits are easy, third one is hard.After you complete the above research for distribution (which for a startup shouldn't take more than 8 hours) it's time to shift our focus to#contentI cannot emphasize this enough, do any black hat techniques, do whatever back linking, do any amount of SEO hacks none of it matters if your content is not excellent.Most companies spend 80-90% of their SEO#timeon things other than content. While it should be the other way around.There is no cure for bad content. You'll be surprised how many things you can get away with if you stop EVERYTHING ELSE and focus on just good content. Write compelling, thoughtful, well researched content and reap the benefits for YEARS. Your content should be so well written that you have to NEVER request for backlinks - they should come on their own.Do these 2 basics consistently and Keep Calm. Traffic will come.Don't splurge on expensive tools, consultants (when you're starting) and other guides. just follow the above steps.Any doubts let me know but this has worked for me time and again.",left_only

Know anyone who might be interested?CRAZY Software Developers (Fresher to 1 Year Max)Electronics For You Group is a tech media house, and we seek crazy software developers because we have a crazy IT environment.We need developers who would like to take on the challenge to work on different platforms, and shift many legacy applications to new technologies.Our legacy software was developed on Classic ASP. Then, some new tools got developed onASP.Net. We have quite a few websites on Wordpress, that need customisation and integration. Most of our applications are database centric, where the database is SQL Server. And, now we want to develop our own apps too.WE SEEK...We seek developers who understand that the value of a good algorithm is much more than the language or platform you are developing on.We seek developers who want to demonstrate their ability to handle mutiple platforms and code and develop excellent software.We seek developers who can switch from developing software onASP.netplatform to .PhP to Classic ASP to cloud native platforms.Yes, they will require a couple of days to read about the new encironments/languages, but they will be open to developing software on whichever platform we throw at them.KEY REQUIREMENTSWe need TWO such developers.We don't need any specific degree OR marks OR training certificates.Experience in CLASSIC ASP orASP.NETor .NET Core or WORDPRESS programming will be a bonus.Experience in jQuery, SQL Server will be a Super Bonus.You should be able to demonstrate your experience through contribution to an Open Source project, or a project developed for a client.We need YOU to have answered our basic Online Interview.We need YOU to be comfortable with a WORK FROM HOME arrangement OR be able to work out of our HQ (Okhla Phase 1 New Delhi).We will be singning a bond for 1 year. After that, we will help you to get good placements.
