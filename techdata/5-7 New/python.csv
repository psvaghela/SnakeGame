Akash Paliwal,Founder & CEO at BenchOnDemand (Fastest way to hire & deploy contractual bench resources),"Read this before you apply for your next job.A maximum number of CVs/Resumes come with an Objective OR Summary about the candidate & that too with only text written in it. It is disheartening how applicants are wasting that top space of their profile (until and unless you are a fresher and have not done any project/related work).Hiring managers have less than 2 to 3 minutes to review it & believe me, they hate long texts (with no relevance to the position) and love to read numbers.Here is an example of summaries for a business development profile. I am sure you will find the numbers attractive and prefer ""summary B"" over ""summary A"" anytime.Why? Because numbers do magic.Make your CV shine in this competitive world and improve your chances of getting an interview call instead of forcing the hiring manager to click the next candidate's CV.Here are some examples & you can add this in your profile summary and put your numbers in your preferred way before applying for a job.It matters!!Example:1- If you are a techie, you can put your summary below (you can change it anyway in your preferred way):a- Total Experience -b- Relevant Experience -c- Total number of projects handled as an individual -d- Total number of projects handled with the team -e- Total certifications (if any) - Show your certifications/courses heref- Major tech stack worked on - Name your skillsg- Communication skill - (rating out of 5 i.e. 4/5 or 3/5 or 5/5)h- Notice Period - Immediate/ <week /<15 days / 30 days / 45 days / 60 days/ 90 days2- If you are a recruiter (you can change it anyway in your preferred way):a- Total Experience -b- Monthly average hiring numbers -c- Total number of onboardings done as of now -d- Average number of interviews taken per day -e- Certifications (if any) - Show your certifications/courses heref- Major tech/non-tech skills hired - Name what you are good at within hiring (Tech resources i.e. Python developers, ML, etc...)g- Communication skill - (rating out of 5 i.e. 4/5 or 3/5 or 5/5)h- Notice Period - Immediate/ <week /<15 days / 30 days / 45 days / 60 days/ 90 daysSearch your numbers so that you can show them on top.Food for thought:Don't waste this important space (summary) in your CV.
