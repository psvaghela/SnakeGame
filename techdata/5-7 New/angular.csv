Kalpa Senanayake,Technical Lead at Vodafone,"Many software deliveries ended up with one or more forms of failure. Some projects or products could not be delivered on time. Others do not meet the client, consumer expectations. Some deliveries achieve expectations but fail to retain key people who contributed due to the burnout caused by the project.Over the past ten years, I have been involved in various software deliveries. Some are project-oriented others are product-oriented. I have been learning from these engagements, observing what worked well and what failed.These reasons are from my own first-hand experience of where things went wrong. These are neither the only reasons for failures nor the suggestions to address the underlying problems.I am keen to listen to examples you may have experienced and how you have solved those.
